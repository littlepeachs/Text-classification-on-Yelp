"1","Sleazy, Ponzi-scheme, timeshare fraud.  My bf is on the phone with them right now trying to get his money back because, naturally, they spring that b.s. timeshare tour on you after you pay, but before you book, and they blacked out the weekend we need to go (January 18-19, 2014). This is a multi-sport tournament weekend when 7, 000 athletes from around the world come to Vegas to compete and have fun. \n\nAren't these damn timeshare gimmicks illegal by now?  \n\nAlso, my bf is a Hilton Honors member. I'm floored that they're treating him like this. \n\nBtw, he's still on the phone with them. I've written this review while he's been on the phone with them. \n\nYa know...if it sounds too good to be true...it probably is. \n\nDo NOT be lured into this farce."
"5","Excellent food. Excellent service. Excellent ambiance.... I could drone on and on gushing to say more, but these few words sum up this place beautifully. I will most definitely return any time I come home to Vegas. Highly recommended!!!"
"1","The dog volunteers and front desk were so friendly.  The volunteers in kitty city were another story.  I've never had people make me feel like less than a human being than I did there.  A human being who came ready to adopt this afternoon had one of the cat volunteers given me the time of day.  I'm really sad cause I am a cat lover and our cat died in November.  The dog people were so nice I thought for sure kitty city would be the same.  I fell in love with a kitten in minutes but the attendants gave me either funny looks or completely ignored me for a family that was still looking around.  The service here broke my heart.  They are doing such a great service for animals, but I didnt feel welcome.  I'll have to find someplace else to go."
"4","Been going here for years and never had an issue.  Just had dinner there last night and the service was great from start to finish.  The food came out hot and ready for us.  The Cheese Steak is always a hit as is the Chicken Cheese.  Had the Pizza before and the sauce is of a different spice than most.  It is really good, and not your ordinary tomato sauce.\n\nKeep up the great job!"
"4","Great experience!!! I hadn't tried the Mesa location yet and I went in for a yummy bowl of pasta and left not only satisfied, but incredibly grateful for my wonderful bartender/server! If you make it into this location make sure you ask for Ashley! She is fun and spunky and fast on her feet. She knew all the regulars and her smile was contagious! Best experience at  Oregano's by far. I will be back for the Big Rig and Ashley."
"4","I love love love Angel Sweet, I just wish it was not in Chandler! It's a little bit pricier than most gelato shops I have been to in Phoenix, but not a big deal. They have a nice variety of choices, but my favorite by far is brownie batter, but they only have it every once in a while."
"2","For $50 per person and the acclaimed best seafood buffet in Las Vegas, this was a huge let down as well. We've gone here before and the food usually was ok. Walking out of the restaurant, you didn't mind that the cost was one of the highest buffet costs in town. However, this time around, the food quality was very poor. There were several items where we had one bite and decided not to finish the rest of it. The lobster tails were highly engulfed in butter along with other seafood options. The taste was poor. The crab legs were decent as it had a fairly sweet taste to the crab meat. However, almost everything else on the buffet line was dry and poorly seasoned. I don't know if they are cutting back due to the economy, but to continue charging that price while delivering subpar food quality leaves us not wanting to make another trip back to this buffet anytime soon."
"4","I was in the area and saw on the Yelp app that Two Sisters' Thai Food was near by. So I stopped in to check them out, I always get Pad Thai as my measure of what a Thai restaurant can do. My Pad Thai was good and came with chicken and shrimp; it was on point as far a flavor was concerned the noodles could have been a bit more al dente for my taste but rice noodles can be tricky. My husband ordered the Basil rice and it was perfect great flavor and nice pieces of sliced chicken.\n\nThis time we ordered to go but next time I will order for dining area since it had a nice vibe to it. While waiting on my order I noticed that they offer a nice weekly rotating lunch special that offers 3 different Entrees each day of the week; including an Egg roll or Spring roll and a small bowl of the soup of the day for $7.99 10:30-2:30."
"1","General Tso's chicken was absolutely dreadful. I love general tso's chicken, and figured it would be a hard dish to screw up, considering most of it is prepackaged and deep fried. Well, they made it quite unpalatable. The won tons served with it were stale.  \n\nHaving a gust of wind sweep $8 out of my hand to never be found again would be a preferable alternative to spending $8 here and eating their food."
"3","Eigentlich ganz nettes Caf\u00e9 in der Akademiestra\u00dfe. Ich war in den letzten Jahren vielleicht 5-6 mal dort und hab mich aber nicht sonderlich wohl gef\u00fchlt. \n\nDen Service empfand ich als ziemlich tr\u00e4ge und wenn man sich im Sommer erfrischen m\u00f6chte (ja, das tut man in einem Caf\u00e9), frage ich mich was diese 0,2l Mikroflaschen Cola Light sollen. Reicht im Prinzip gerade zum Zunge befeuchten. \n\nSicher ganz stylisch zum sich treffen, aber mein Favorit ist das Max sicherlich nicht. Dann doch lieber gegen\u00fcber ins Vapiano oder erst einmal zum B\u00e4cker auf der Kaiserstra\u00dfe, um den Durst zu l\u00f6schen ."
"2","As a players card member, I am so incredibly disappointed in this casino. After playing for about 10 minutes at the table and quitting to cash in my meager winnings, I was forced to wait for at least 10 minutes in line for the cashier. For such a large casino, it is unconscionable to have only three windows open for cashing in chips. And to see the number of people idle behind the closed windows was even more infuriating. Gamble elsewhere."
"3","After a canceled flight, I wound up spending my airline meal vouchers here for dinner and a breakfast. The prices for dinner change daily, depending on the night's theme cuisine. My night was BBQ and it cost about $15.\n\nLike a lot of sub $20 buffets, the food offerings here need to be attacked with a strategy in mind. I have my own system for deciding what to pick, but the most important buffet rule is to immediately stop eating anything that isn't GOOD. There's a lot of crap at this buffet and a lot of stuff that's so-so, but there's some real good stuff to be eaten, as long as you're not busy chowing down on dried-out, fake, instant, imitation, bland funk.\n\nI found the roasted chicken to be excellent, like actually worthy of being on a plate being served in a regular restaurant. The crawdads were unique and it was my first time trying them. I didn't care for the taste, but I don't have anything to compare them to, so I switched over to the peel and eat shrimp. The salad bar was decent enough. The bread pudding was amazingly good. The service sucked, as my water was never refilled, I had to scrounge for a second napkin, and at one point my table was totally cleared while I was up getting more food.\n\nBreakfast was about $8. The OJ was fake and tasted funny. The coffee was not bad, but not good. Skip scrambled eggs as they're fake too. Instead, get your eggs off the top off the Benedict offerings. You don't want to eat the whole Benedict, just the egg, as the rest is gross. I have a weakness for cheap-o breakfast sausage with syrup on top and I wasn't disappointed. Don't bother hoping for a nice pastry to pair with your last cup of coffee because they're all pretty horrible.\n\nOverall, FMB is worth the price it seems, but don't think you're going to get the variety of a full buffet, as most of the food is no good. Be picky and search out the few gems to be found, then jump in with both feet."
"2","I hate to do this to you Fukuburger, but why is the food here not up to par to the truck. Although I must add a disclaimer because I had this location a few weeks after they were opened, so maybe they improved?. I had the Katsu one and at first it came out burnt and I really did not want to sent it back but it tasted terrible. I was also scared they would spit in my food because of that myth of sending back food to the kitchen. I showed the cashier and she was actually really nice about it and the kitchen staff didn't seem to mind. I got my katsu the second time and it was cooked fine but I thought it lacked flavor. To add to that, the prices here are kind of ridic, but I guess that is sort of understandable since it's on the strip? But with higher prices the food should at least be good and this is why they are getting 2 stars from me. I'll definitely have to try them again at the LINQ or just stick to eating at the truck."
"5","Loved it! I was visiting from NYC with a few friends, and we decided to try this place. We were pleasantly surprised. The sashimi was fresh, the rolls were original and very creative, and the staff and management were extremely friendly to our table.  I personally enjoyed the casual environment- a fun crowd, hip music in the background, espn on their plasma screens, etc. I'm a big sushi fan, and Sake Bomber did not disappoint!"
"3","While the staff was excellent, the food and beverages were highly average. We had wings, tomato & mozzarella, burger and salads. The wings had a pomegranate BBQ sauce, which was good. The bill came to $24. I think the Hilton Tapatio staff are exceptional, but the food here lacks imagination. Not overly memorable."
"3","Honey walnut shrimp. I was craving some yesterday, so despite the negative reviews on here, I decided to stop by for lunch. Honey walnut shrimp is $11.95 and comes with a generous amount of shrimp and a side of white rice. The food took about 10 minutes so I know they made it fresh. I really enjoyed my food and I have nothing negative to say about this particular visit."
"5","I'm from the area and my family loved this place when I was younger, I was never a fan. My mom still loves it and wanted to go here for her birthday recently. Of course, we reluctantly agreed. There were about 15 of us with no reservations on a Saturday night. We were seated quickly and our waitress was awesome. I hadn't been in so long and didn't like it when I was there, so I asked my sister what to order. She gets the chicken romano. I decided I would give it a try... OMG! It was absolutely amazing. It's a thin piece of chicken, breaded and fried, then placed on melted butter (almost overflowing the plate) and topped with green onions and garlic. It was the size of the plate so I didn't eat the side of spaghetti that came with it. Since this visit, I have been back weekly and would recommend the NY Style Mild Wings and the Chicken Romano, sometimes I get them on the same visit and take the leftovers home. Portions are huge, service is great and the flavored iced tea is awesome! We will continue to visit and hope the food stays the same!\n\nSide note: We went there two nights ago with our 1 year old daughter and realized we were out of milk, we asked if we could order a tall glass of milk. The waiter said he'd be glad to fill the bottle for us, so he asked us to take the lid off and filled it. When our bill came the milk was not on there. We asked them about it and they said, on the house!"
"2","The concept is great. Cheap groceries. A good selection of produce. Slam dunk right? Sadly, for me, it isn't.\n\nThis location is small (I havent been to others) and with everyone pushing around shopping carts, there is no room to walk around and grab the produce or items I need.\n\nThe prices are great, but the quality of the produce isn't the best. It's always hit or miss. A good example...Each morning, I squeeze myself a glass of orange juice from the market. Mariana's tends to be a tad cheaper than the ones at Food 4 Less, but the Mariana's oranges look like they are the red-headed step child of beautiful navel oranges. Bumpy, and they look abnormally large. I don't want steroids in my fruit or my baseball players. I don't even know if you can roid up fruit, but these oranges do NOT look natural.\n\nI'll pay a buck more for piece of mind. Oh yeah, and Food 4 Less is across the street."
"5","I was recently a first time home buyer.  A friend of mine recommended that I get in touch with Chris Morrison, who had helped her buy her first house and she was happy to share her great experience with me.  When I met Chris, I was greeted with a warm and honest smile.  I immediately felt comfortable and that I was in good hands.  He showed me a couple of homes and I became well aware that he knew a great deal of the ins and outs of the business.  Within days he found me a house that I loved and I couldn't be any happier with the area and my first home!  I will be referring everyone to him from here on out."
"1","Food,staff & service all very very poor.interiors very depressing.u are better of cooking Indian food at home it will turn out better than anything served at this place"
"2","When this place was named Jacqueline's , I never had an issue with the place - In fact, they used to have the best muffins, enough to warrant me making a road trip from North Scottsdale just to get a muffin and espresso.\n\nAlthough I realize that there are many good reviews associated with Cafe Carumba, this restaurant simply does not fall into the \""foodie\"" category.\n\nI always have an issue with slow service especially when considering that the dining room is half empty. Second issue is the service staff too busy chattering or catching up with the latest gossip, rather than paying close attention to guests.\n\nThe third issue is having a table that was seated after me, being served before me. And when it took literally forever for my order to arrive, not even an apology was extended. ON top of that, after that near exasperating wait, being charged for an extra order of tortillas.\n\nCafe Carumba is really not my idea of the ideal or cozy breakfast spot. It is amazing what  name change can do to the soul of a place. Okay, I agree and sympathize with the fact that restaurants can have an off day...but I always seem to be the victim!"
"1","For the price students pay this place sucks!  I blame the campus leaders and planners, mainly the president, because they supposedly just remodeled it.  The selection is among the most limited I've ever seen @ a major research institution.  You want a burger, you're going to get a burger, you want a salad, you get a salad, you want pizza, you get pizza; nothing extraordinary, cheap quality at best!  I pity the students that waste their money on a meal plan here when they can literally eat right across the street for a fraction of the cost and get good quality and selection.  UNLV needs to support their Dining Commons way more than they are presently as it is a sad excuse."
"1","***WARNING*** Dr. Nishihara can and will help your children, that's only if you don't mind being disrespected in front of them and brought to tears on some visits.  He is rude and obviously has no children of his own. I will no longer be seeing this Doctor because I feel we have been in a verbally abusive relationship and are finally free of the bullying despite his education."
"2","I have a lot better things to do than go into a bar that's big claim to fame is the fact that it has a big tree with a string of christmas lights on it.\n\nI've been in here once, and once was enough.  If you are actually sitting in one of the few places to sit, all that means is that you are such a huge lush that you got there at 6 o'clock.  So, you can wipe that smirky look off your face, drunko."
"1","If you really are a experience foodie whom loves seafood, you are going to hate this place. I went with my Mom and Husband and we ordered the fried Alligator to start. It wasnt bad  with the first bite but the longer it sat it turned into some weird texture. We love the Fried Alligator at Pappadeaux and was excited to have a restaurant closer to our homes that serves it. It looked different, taste different and really made us wonder what we were eating.\n\nFor our Main dishes, I ordered the boiled shrimp, hubby had catfish, and mom the Etoufee. My shirmp looked good when they came, however when I went to eat them i noticed that there were not cleaned. You can see a clear sign of both veins in the top and bottom of the shirmp. Mind you I am a seafood junkie and I have had shrimp in Hawaii from a truck and prepared the same way and were cleaned. I told the manager about this and he said that they don't clean their shrimp nor did they have too. I sent them back and did not order anything else. My mom's Etouffee looked like a can of Cream of Chicken soup an jiggled like Jello. Matter of fact it was the exact color of Cream of Chicken soup. If you have never had Etouffee this might fly. However, I have had my first experience with Cajun Cusine in New Orleans, LA and none of this looked or tasted like Cajun cusine. \n\nNow to my husbands Catfish?? I really don't believe it was Catfish. It was shaped like Chicken Breast and the texture was totally different. \n\nNeedless to say, I am a extreme foodie who dines out at least 4x a week or more. I love Cajun food and was so excited to have a place closer to my house than my favorite in  West Phoenix, Pappadeaux's.\n\nHowever, besides this food not tasting good, it is a disgrace to everything that relates to Cajun Cuisine. We gladly left while not to mention the Manager, Bar Tender, and waitress all decided to go for a smoke break in the front of the restaurant while patrons were still eating. We said goodbye and never returned again."
"1","This location closes early, and on the night I visited they were closed before their posted time."
"2","I'm only giving this place 2 stars because of the chili cheese fries. Otherwise, my burger was dry and seemed to be one of those frozen ones you buy at the grocery store. Gross. My husband's pulled pork sandwich was dry and not enough sauce. Not to mention that the service was sad. Will never return, even if I was staying at the Flamingo."
"3","Surprisingly, it was one of very few things open when I went out looking for food. The service was good. Food was OK."
"5","Great for serious BBQ cookers. No better place to get supplies. If they don't have it that can usually get it.  Bring you truck because you will want to buy it all.  $18.00 for a 2 cubic foot bag of 1/2 cut logs I bought almond, peach and hickory today.  There is no other place to stock up on BBQ product in Vegas."
"3","Newington Coffee Shop is sporting quite an 80s signage, emphasising that it's not an overly self conscious, trendy cafe like the ones you would find further up towards the Royal Mile. But if you're like me and enjoy some good old fashioned grub, that's not a bad thing.\n\nThey've got an impressive amount of sandwich fillings on the menu, with create your own deals being at the cheap end of cheap. Bacon rolls won't break the bank either if you're in need of a quick hangover fix before going to uni.\n\nI was famished after walking miles around Edinburgh the other week and Newington's certainly filled a gap. It's not cuisine but if I'm getting a quick brew and a cheap bite, I'm happy enough!"
"4","This place is great! Nice location and great food. I sat outside and enjoyed the weather and the scenery. \n\nNormally when I eat, I seem to end up eating my meat first and veggies/sides last. Well this was a first. The creamed potatoes and cabbage were the two best things on my plate! They were finished before anything. The mac and cheese was good also. The fried chicken was not the best I've ever had, but definitely not bad. \n\nThe only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because of the cornbread. Weird, especially since they have a bakery attached, but the cornbread was not good at all. One bite, and I placed it on the side, and never touched it.\n\nI also had the cheese plate appetizer which was delicious."
"4","Amazing food and worth the wait! We had the fun of playing \""the game\"" with our waiter. He asked questions about our preferences and then custom ordered burgers for us. We had the jalape\u00f1o poppers for an app... Seriously yummy. My burger had 4 cheeses, mushrooms and avocado... The bun is even amazing. Often long lines to be seated... Come prepared with a cocktail.. :-)"
"5","I had sushi and sashimi that I never knew existed here.  Thank God the server knew what to recommend because by reading the menu, as a Nobu neophyte I had no idea what was good.  Yeah, I ended up dropping over $100 per person but I knew it was going to be expensive anyways so come with a fat wallet if you want to eat here.  I remember the Black Cod melting in my mouth and the exotic trout which shocked my tongue in a good way.  The Kobe beef was heavenly...  Just thinking about this meal has me wondering when I'll be in Vegas again.  Just don't order the regular sushi though, I heard it's good but it's probably something you can get at any decent sushi joint that you live near.  You have to get the \""special\"" menu items."
"4","When I use to work in London, I always looked forward to having a pint at the end of the day with my friends. \n\nBesides their incredible food, Cornish Pasty has the feel that reminds me very much of an English pub. The food is the real star here, but the beers they have on tap are outstanding. \n\nOne of my favorite, is the north London brewer Fuller's Extra Special Bitter(ESB). It's fresh, tasty and took me back to the City pubs of my youth. Granted the beer back then was warmer. LOL\n\nAs we sat waiting for our server, you could see everyone was happy to be here. We sat near the bar, to the right of where the cooks are preparing the meals. Pretty soon all those dozen or so bar stools were taken. There was a lot of laughing. Folks being happy at the end of the work week and enjoying each others company. What a great atmosphere!\n\nWe started with the 20 oz/ pint of the Fuller's ($6.00) that I mentioned (photo) and glass of the Leitz Out ($6.50) Riesling. Both hit the spot nicely. \n\nFor dinner we ordered the Bangers and Mash pasty, along with the Rosemary Chicken pasty and shared some English Oven garlic chips ($3.50). I believe the chicken might have been the better of the two pasty, but not by much!\n\nBoth, had a sophisticate layering of flavors, that were subtle and very nice.  In the hands of a different Chef, you could see how the flavors might have overwhelm the palette. But not here. Surprising they were only $9.00 each. Incredible. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the Chocolate Bread Pudding ($6.00) and the Apple Carmel Pasty ($5.00). Both were also delicious. \n\nEach of the above items were very filling. We couldn't finish them, or the desserts. So we had four \""to go\"" boxes for later. I've posted several pictures and we really had a fun time.  Our bill came to a fair $49.07 including taxes, but before gratuities. \n\nWe'll be back. Enjoy!"
"4","The chicken was really delicious. The palabok and Kare-kare was excellent. The service was fast and friendly. Will come back again."
"4","This is my hometown airport so it's hard to write a bad review (you know, local pride and all that). I fly in and out of McCarran a lot. It's a serviceable airport with fairly easy parking and decent services. It's an older airport so it shows its age, but since Vegas attracts tourists from all walks of life from all over the world, it's a great place to people watch between flights. My favorite is to watch when people get off a plane from, say, Newark, and then they head straight for the in-airport slot machines. Only in Vegas. The new Terminal 3 wing is super nice and shiny but lacks adequate seating (and the security lines can be ridiculously long). If you are traveling out of Terminal 3 you need to allow at least 30 more minutes than you think you need."
"4","Dear Montreal,\n\nThank you for renewing my faith in a place that should be enjoyed by everyone (the Lookout).  Arrived here in the morning, and there was not a piece of trash, cans, bottle, or anything garbage like to be seen.  Also it smelled like fresh air, not cigarettes, or fermenting alcohol bottles. \n\nAlso, did not see the obese raccoon."
"3","I'm not a fan of sweets. However, I wanted to give The Cupcakery a try. While I don't like cupcakes, I do like carrot cake. So we decided to split a Bugsy, carrot cake with cream cheese topping. It was pretty decent as far as cupcakes go. It was a little too sweet for me and I let my wife eat most of it. As we were leaving I saw they had miniature cupcakes. If we go back, I'll probably get one of them as that's about all the sweet I can handle. They do have a nice variety, and I wouldn't mind trying some more. The minis should serve me well for that."
"5","Outstanding memories of this place...Valentines Day 1999...Absolutely first class service, highly polished cooking, but very conscious of its Southwestern surroundings, this place still stacks up against the best. If you can deal with amusing and effete clientele (bombed-out Barry Goldwater Republicans) then Vincent's well worth the expense."
"3","Where to start?  The Southend version of the Common Market has many things to talk about, and I'm sure I'll miss something.\n\nFirst, you have the market.  On that front, it's not bad.  I mean, it's a market.  They are a bit on the funky side, but generally they aren't much different than any other convenience store.\n\nNext you have the \""deli\"", where they serve up fare that is generally healthier than your usual fast food, and at a decent pace (unless they are busy, which can happen).  The only thing that is a bit bizarre here is you go to the back to order, then back to the front to pay, perhaps shopping while you make it there, then wander around while you wait, then pick up your food - and you don't typically have to show a receipt that you did pay.  You also have to guess as to when it's ready, because they don't let you know and they don't bring it out to you.  And there isn't a sign saying that you go through this process.  You're just supposed to know (or ask).  It's not bad, it's just awkward, and more so for first-timers.\n\nFinally you have the patio, often adorned with lights of some kind, and usually featuring dogs, music and a variety of clientele.  It can actually be quite a nice place to enjoy your food and even an offering of the CM, such as a beer tasting.  The downside?  Even if there aren't many people there who are smoking, it smells like smoke.  If you smoke, it's not a big deal, but if you don't, it's a bit overwhelming.\n\nAs to the food?  It's decent.  Much of the packaged food, even the not-quite-what-you-would-find-elsewhere stuff, it's not generally outstanding, because it is packaged after all.  What you get from the deli is typically good, but it may not be worth the hassle of everything else.  Probably better than what you or I could make at home, but maybe not, as I have no idea who you are.  I only know my own limitations."
"5","THE number is 602-995-2122\n\nI have asked YELP to correct it."
"5","My husband and I love this little gem of a neighborhood bar. We are constantly on the hunt for best \""bar burger\"" (so we have a lame hobby...whatever, it's fun!) and we agree that Villa Tap is one of the best bar burgers in town. Jenny St ground chuck, fresh veggies on the burgs, good bun, also they have good apps (love the cheddar broccoli bites)...all good so far. Good Bloody Mary's too. We haven't tried the fish fry yet, but it's on the to-do list. We actually went there for Valentine's Day - wanted to avoid the crowds, in the mood for a good cheeseburger, etc - had a great time. The burgers were top-notch, jukebox is great (they have a weird abundance of live Dead, which is great). The regular customers are nice and friendly also - it's not an intimidating \""townie-bar\"" (hello, Tip Top!) but the regulars are SO nice and fun to talk to. Owner Chico is really nice, and we love that he's going out of his way to buy local ingredients and beer. He's got House of Brews on tap even! Unusual fact - the inside of the bathroom stalls are painted with chalkboard paint and have chalk available to write messages. We really don't have complaints at this point. We're excited to try their brunch soon!"
"1","The Summerlin Dance Academy in Las Vegas is not for anyone that wants to be a professional dancer. The instructors that the school has, currently, have poor qualifications, the parents are vulgar (while waiting for children and while attending the recital), and the director of the school only has administrative experience and zero dance experience or perspective. The only good thing about the school is that they dress the kids well, at the recital, so that when the children to not improve their dance skills, nor learn noted techniques, they at least look cute and impress low-expectant parents. For best results, please find a qualified private dance teacher or a better and more classical dance institution, for your child."
"5","I have eaten at this In-n-out numerous times because my co-worker lives over this way.\n\nWhenever we are hungry and craving a fast bite, In-n-out never fails me.\nAlways consistent with the food and the service.\nTOP NOTCH!!!\n\nIll take a double double hold the onions, fries and a lemonade.\n\nHard to believe something so simple is so good.\n\nEasiest 5 stars ever!!!"
"5","it's the best pizza I've ever eaten. Yes, it's a bit pricey, long waits, blah blah blah. Don't care. I love you."
"5","As we walked in, we were greeted by a friendly cashier.  Since it was my friend's first time there, he gave us the run down on their menu. I ordered a half sized rice bowl with luau pork, steak and brown rice and my friend ordered the Oahu fish sandwich special. \nYou get a number and they bring the food out to your table.  Before our food arrived, they gave us complimentary chips and salsa (their version). The chips were a bit thick and hard but fresh and the salsa was pretty good and mild.  \n\nMy friend loved her fish sandwich with her mix of regular and sweet potato fries. The fish looked crunchy and the bun was soft. The sweet potato fries were my favorite - they are crinkle cut!  \n\nMy bowl was abundant with perfectly cooked rice and the highlight was the luau pork, it was divine!   The steak was good but you don't get much of it with the half portion. I loved the veggies - zucchini, carrots and broccoli. I think their rice bowls are much better than Samarai Sam's by far.  SO many choices!!  My only suggestion is for them to not serve so much rice. It's a bit of a waste....I would rather get more veggies. Maybe I will ask next time!  They also gave me two sauces on the side because I couldn't choose between the jerk or the teriyaki. The jerk was a bit salty for my taste but the teriyaki was perfect.  Of course, too much rice and sauce preference is a personal thing ;-)\n\nI am a stickler for iced tea and they had that yummy tropical tea that you usually get at some of the Asian chains. \n\nOverall, the service, atmosphere and food were great! I will definitely be going back."
"2","The meat was ok but there is not a big selection for the price.  $20 for lunch and $30 for dinner with about 8 items for lunch and 13 for dinner. My friends and me ended up getting sick the next day so, I will not go back to this place again."
"4","There was nothing I didn't like about the experience. We started our meal off with the bruschetta which was topped with delicious marinated tomatoes. Then I had the citrus marinated beet salad with goat cheese. Divine! Best salad that I have ever had! My partner had the radish cucumber salad which he said was a little plain (thus only 4 stars). Now for the incredible entrees... I had eggplant Parmesan which was simply incredible, it was served with a pasta which was a perfect balance of rich, creamy, garlicky. Yummy! My partner had the rigatoncini with Piemontese meat sauce and he said it was delicious! And to top it off, our drinks were perfectly made each time.  We didn't order any speciality cocktails but stuck with out favorites; a greyhound and Jack and Coke.\n\nOf course, I must mention the service... I was satisfied. Food came out at a nice pace and everybody was friendly and polite.\n\nI highly recommend this place especially if you're staying anywhere near Crystals high end shopping mall."
"4","There were plenty of seating, nice decorations, and service was fast.\n\nThe reason why I took off a star is the portion size are a little on the small side. Between the 7 of us, we ordered about 5 different dishes with extra rice and usually at most places, it's enough but not here.\n\nThe pad thai, green curry, and papaya salad were delicious. I was satisfied with the taste of the food. My taste buds were giving me high fives. I believe this is primarily a Thai restaurant so get Thai dishes and NOT the Chinese. One of the stir-fry dishes we ordered was meh."
"2","Our group decided to do the all day buffet because it was cheap and easy. Maybe we should have saved the stomach aches and long hours on the potty and just spent money on decent food. Well see the foods not that bad.. its just i can't eat three meals of stale food. Breakfast was whateves. Standard stuff but they had fried rice and array of wtf \""breakfast\"" foods out.. Lunch rolled around and low and behold the same exact shit we had for breakfast! They added some fried chicken but that was basically it. Dinner was better but i really can't eat stale food all day. Boo"
"4","Their service has improved tremendously and the staff is very upbeat and proactive."
"1","I was debating as to give this place 1 or 2 stars, and settled on 1, because not only have I experienced WAY better, but this was the worst $200 dinner I have had in Vegas yet!  We went there because we were seeing Garth Brooks, so the evening was already starting off on a high note!!  The bread was ok at best, and then I got to the cranberry bread which broke my tooth!  Literally bitting into this piece of BREAD broke my tooth.  Fortunately it didn't hurt and there was nothing that was going to keep me from that concert, so we kept pushing.  The Tuna Tartar came out and it was so spicy, myy tongue was now burnt for the rest of the meal.  My husband said his salad was good, but I know him and if it was good, the plate would have been wiped clean and there was a lot left.\n\nAs for the main dish, I ordered the Black Bass, given fish is my favorite thing and bass is at the top of the list... It had NO taste!  I could have continued eating it, it was edible, but what was the point when there was no taste!  As a side I ordered the pistachio crusted asparagus which was different and the only thing that peaked my interest enough to eat.  My husband ordered the filet, he said his was \""not bad\"" but next time he would get it \""without all the salt around it\"".  He also got the mac & cheese, which I tried and was good, but for the price of this meal, I was REALLY GOOD!!\n\nTo top the meal off I had chosen the s'mores donuts... 2 of my favorite things in the world, what could possibly be wrong with these???  Bleh!  Again, no taste and while the concept is great, they failed on delivery!\n\nMy husband and I love a good steakhouse and do not mind spending the money when we walk away satisfiied...  If it were up to me I would eat at Mastro's Ocean Club every night, but with all the options in this town, it can't hurt to branch out....  Well in this case it did \""hurt\"" and a broken tooth from bread should have been an omen to stop right there!  :)\n\nOn a positive note, Garth Brooks was phenominal!!"

"2","Sun and Ski is a decent all around Outdoor Sports store.  I have wandered around here many a time looking at various clothing for running and winter sports.  I will say that they lack seriously in the cycling apparel department.  They have 2 racks (1 clearance) for women and it was mostly shorts.  If you are looking for cycling apparel then stick to Bike stores that concentrate on this or buy online.  Their hiking supplies are a little limited as well and pricey but you can find some small items in abundance.  They do however, have helpful staff especially when dealing with their Yakima selection.  All in all, Sun and ski is so general that if you want a good selection in one area of activity then it's best to find a store that specializes in that."
"2","Food was decent. The nachos were great but the tacos were just ok. Atmosphere was fun but not the greatest meal in Vegas."
"1","So I went to this bar last night with a group from work. The bar tender was extremely friendly and had a great personality. This was during the Sunday night football game so there were roughly 15 people in the bar. After the game, it was only my group of 3 and 1 other customer. So we moved to a table and attempted to order food! There seemed to be a waitress on site but did not come to our table! I had to walk up to the kitchen window and order food as if I was at McDonalds!! Only difference is McDonalds would have had better service! The \""waitress\"" seemed to not care about anything except the fact she was friends with the owner! I asked if there was any specials and the girl yelled to the bar tender \""is the game on still on\""! Once she realized the game was over she said NOPE! Sense it was a celebration with my team, I ordered a pizza anyway! I should have taken my team to Pizza Hut, the service would have been better and the food sure would have as well! No need to stop or order food from here it will be a waste of time and money!"
"2","We dined here for dinner on Thanksgiving Day with our good friends that were visiting from Hawaii. I don't know where to begin, but this place was such a disaster.\n\nService was horrible and slow. Extremely slow. So it was Thanksgiving night and they were busy, but it wasn't a full house in the restaurant. Our server (I guess I'll be nice and not mention his name) was never around. I think we only saw him 3 times. The first time was when he took our orders. Then he disappeared for an hour. We also waited over an hour for our food. He finally zoomed passed us right before we got our food, and then WE had to flag him down to get some drinks. The third time, he brought us the bill. Horrible. The guy who refilled our waters provided better service! \n\nThe food wasn't too great in my opinion. The bread that they served us in the beginning was too hard and the butter was pretty frozen. I ordered the center cut Filet Mignon. The glaze on top of it was tasty, but the rest of the steak lacked flavor. It was also kind of dry. The bottom line: it needed salt. I also ordered the seasoned jumbo steak fries as my side. The seasoning made them taste weird. I couldn't really figure out was it was but it did leave a spicy after taste. The steak knives that they gave us were very dull as well. My husband and one of our friends ordered the dry-aged New York Sirloin. They both said it needed salt. Our other friend ordered the queen cut prime rib and enjoyed it. So at least one of us liked our food. \n\nFYI - the bathroom is a hoax! You open the first door with a sign that says \""restrooms.\"" Then it leads you to a second door with a sign that says \""restrooms.\"" When you open that door, it leads you to the nearby restrooms in the casino. LOL.\n\nThe bottom line: Not recommended and the steaks need salt. You know its bad when you have to have salt, A1, ketchup, and whatever else to make your steak edible!"
"2","Had an appointment to get liquid gel nails done.  The lady who did my nails was very rude and I didn't like how they turned out. I tired to communicate with her but was ignored.  Will not return,  would not recommend."
"5","This is an old school barber.  No computers, no appt's, just walk ins, cuts and shaves.  I've had cuts from Steph, my boy Danny, and ole school Ray.  Haven't got one from George though.  I don't think the dude has time for me.  I do notice they like to get out of there as early as possible (5PM on weekdays), but I guess who doesn't.  It's just tough to get in at times even when you walk in at 3PM.  I think the place is a work in progress.  For example, Steph cut my hair right when she started and it wasn't great.  However, I got it cut again from her two weeks ago, and it was damn near perfect!  Good job!  Ray is great and consistant.  Danny is awesome too.  The shop is looking better and better.  Just hope they extend their hours a bit (maybe stay open late one night a week).  I'll be going back every three weeks though.  Keep it up George."
"4","Not only is the bbq close to me but I can also get gas and a car wash at the same location lol. The food is really good but the sauce is just so so and thats the only reason it's not getting a 5 star."
"2","Decor- AMAZING! Love the design and I was impressed with the space. Open, welcoming but still really modern. Doesn't feel like a \""Vegas\"" bar at all.\n\nBar- Nice place to sit and have a chat over a glass of wine or beer.\nStaff- a tad flighty, but experienced enough to get your drinks to you.....just don't bother them with food orders and god forbid you have to send something back!\nThere were several of us eating dinner at the bar....and every single one of use sent something back.\n\nFood- well now. I loved the menu! So many great twists on there that I wanted to try...but I settled for a wedge salad and tater tots (easy, good items to compare apples to apples with as I had just eaten another wedge a day or two before)\n\nWedge Salad- MASSIVE, there is NO NEED for 1/2 a head of lettuce on the plate. At least provide a 1/2 order  or small plate for those who want to enjoy the rest of their meal without wasting so much! Decent blue cheese.\n\nTruffle Tater Tots- how do you screw up tater tots? A total waste of the truffles- mushy, undercooked and no flavor whatsoever. I was embarassed for them and embarassed to have to send them back!\n\nFriends Ate:\nTomato and Onion Salad- WAY WAY too many onions! Like a half of an onion versus 2-3 slices of tomato and DRENCHED in balsamic. Not edible- waitress/bartendress didn't think to ask if it was ok and didn't notice only a few bites were eaten.\n\nChicken (veggies on the side)- Chicken was RAW on the inside. Ugh. Sent back and was so over cooked when it came back it was rubbery.  Veggies over cooked. They took this and tater tots off the bill.\n\nChicken Picata- A staple in many kitchens. A request was made for extra capers in the sauce for the chicken and as a side dish, some sauteed mushrooms. Guess where they put the extra capers? That's right- in the mushrooms! None on the chicken! When it was pointed out- they dutifully took the plate back and put capers on the chicken- but did nothing about the mushrooms. Blech!\n\nAnother person with us got food poisoning from the creamed corn the week before (and daringly came back- but didn't eat).\n\nGentleman next to me at the bar (not with us) also had issues with his order- so much so that he coverd the plate with a napkin, left money and just walked out.\n\n\nI know this place had opened recently and there are kinks to work out- but some of this is just ridiculous. Do some test runs, get some feedback BEFORE you open ot the public. You will still have issues, but you will not have to comp so many items and put off so many people on their first experience.\n\nAs I mentioned, the menu looks fantastic, and the atmosphere is really intriguing....so I really would like to come back. Will I? For drinks yes, and I would try to eat something to see if it has changed. It is about 45 minutes from me though- so when?  I wouldn't make it a point of trekking all the way over there just for this place, but if I was in the area...........yes."
"2","Probably not a good day for me to write a review  (day after my Buckeyes were spanked by Florida for the BCS Championship, so I wasn't in the best of spirits.)  \n\nThat said, I'm still one of the more tolerant restauranteurs around, so it pains me to write this review:\n\nI'm dissapointed in this restaurant, I really wanted to like it.\n\n11:50am  My friend and I arrive (good start, nice, artsy, laid back ambience, just to my liking)\n11:55am Seated and served our coffee and soda\n12:00       I ordered The Cortez, my friend, one of the burgers\n12:35pm Concerned about my flight back to San Jose departing just after 2pm, we inquire about the status of our order...something about normally taking 20 minutes, a big catering order, running a little behind.\n12:45pm The table next to us (arriving 10 minutes after us) receives their order as the waitress promises us our orders are finishing up.\n12:52pm Our meal arrives (along w/ our check due to waitress' keen inference that we were now in quite a rush)\n1:05pm Paid and out the door\n1:25pm Arrive at Aiport (thank heavens for web check-in, short security lines, and a 10 minute delay)\n\nIts too bad...the food was quite good and probably would have been even better if we wouldn't have needed to wolf it down.  We were this close to needing to walk out the door.\n\nSo maybe we shouldn't have gone to this place if I knew I needed to catch a flight.  Still, this was slower service than any cafe to which I've been in Europe, which is much more overt about eschewing expedience."
"2","Dear Lord! Where do I start... Waited in line for over 2 hours, the staff opened up another line to give priority to those who were willing to cough-up a few extra bucks, finally got in and we had to take several flights of stairs (mind you, we were wearing heels). $5 tap water, believe it or not. There was no place to sit, no place to actually dance (crowded dance floors), and every EXIT was blocked off. LV's fire marshal needs to inspect this place ASAP! Giving them two stars for playing some hip hop music and for not over-charging us that night considering it was 4th of July."
"1","I've been to this restaurant a couple times. The food has been fine, service has been slow. This visit can be summed up with two words... frozen salmon. \n\nLiterally served four pieces of frozen salmon sashimi on the plate. Not really cold salmon, frozen solid salmon. I politely pointed it out to the server and she called the manager over who proceeded to lecture me about the salmon. \n\nWell, he certainly made his point... I hope it was worth it. No tip and I'll never be back."
"1","I got food poisoning after eating at this location, I almost went to the hospital after about 12hrs of vomiting and diarrhea. I will NEVER eat Arby's again"
"2","I want Tom's to be better... but it isn't.  The place has a cool \""Cheers\"" vibe, the service is excellent, but...\n\nI ordered a grilled cheese.  The simplest thing on the menu, right?  WRONG!  \n\nThose of you who are grilled cheese experts, like I am** will understand when I say: there was no butter on the bread and there was only one paltry slice of american cheese.  Seriously.  At least give me some cheese for my grilled cheese sandwich.  It's even in the title!\n\nI am sure that Tom's has more options for non-carnivores on their huge menu, but I was in a hurry and didn't have time to peruse the menu at length or concoct a special order.\n\nThe worst part?  My sub-par grilled cheese, fries, and iced tea came to $12!!!  Come on!  They put a piece of individually wrapped cheese between two dry pieces of toast!\n\nAt least the service was good.\n\n**side note: I really wish more restaurants would get on the options for vegetarians bandwagon.  No, I do not want iceberg lettuce on a plate with italian dressing, thank you."
"3","3.5 *\n-Located in the Venetian; smaller than I though it was\n-Waited about 15-20 minutes in line\n-Got a table with 2 bottles away from the dance floor which I think was the best option\n-Dance floor hella packed but alot of energy and extras\n-Table service was good - shout out to our waitress Jennifer who was on point\n-Mens bathroom with a line all night but not too bad\n-Good ratio for all u singles out there\n-Good music\n-Other than my friend I had to carry out and take back to the hotel, it was a good night"
"3","I feel like I need to give this restaurant another shot, because despite the great reviews, my experience was less than stellar. Of course, I expected a wait on a Sunday at 11:30am. No problem, the weather was beautiful and the servers brought around samples of chocolate banana nut bread, which was yummy. The wait time was about 30 minutes. \n \nHowever, once were seated, that's where things went a bit downhill.  We were seated at a tiny table in a corner RIGHT by the bathroom. Really? A table shouldn't have even been there in the first place. Not only were we subjected to people walking right up against our food while they were going to and from the restroom, there were a number of flies circling throughout our meal. Since the restaurant was packed, there was nowhere else to move.\n\nOkay.. let's just try to focus on the food and service. The service was great- very attentive, and they must have asked us if they could top off our coffee about 10 times. Toward the end of the meal, we started feeling rushed. I know they were trying to turn the table, but I hate feeling like they are ready for us to get the heck out!\n\nThe food was good, and a good value. The omelettes were nicely sized, and came with potatoes and toast for $8.99. My friend opted to get sliced bananas instead of potatoes (I know-weird), but they came with a hair attached. Yuck.  \n\nI'm not going out of my way to return, but I am not opposed to giving them another shot. Just one more, though."
"2","The noodles before the meal was good. Ordered from the Korean section, got a bowl of noodles floating in fishy, soupy cornstarch, no taste, but smelled fishy. BBQ ribs were soft, but seemed like bottled sauce was poured over the top right before serving. Very disappointed"
"4","Was here last night for a Family Soft Opening. This used to be Carmine's but was gutted and looks great. Plenty of TVs to watch the game. \n\nThe food and drink selection was excellent. The \""Mad Mule\"" was a great cocktail. Food was excellent, very large portions. I enjoyed the Chicken Salad and it was delicious. \n\nI have high expectations for this bar. Hopefully becomes the new local spot!"
"5","This is another one of my absolute favorite spots, I hit it up consistently at least once a week for lunch. My favs are the Dilly Club and their chicken noodle soup. Everything is super fresh, aside from the random slightly stale breadbowl (although if you get one that's super fresh, it's like heaven!) It can get a little hectic in there, especially during peak lunch times, but the service is usually pretty good, they've only messed up my order on two occassions and they corrected it promptly. If you haven't had a Dilly's experience yet, go with the half sandwich/small soup combo, the soups are phenomenal and they all go well with the sandiwches. I usually break down and get a cookie, too...the double chocolate or the M&M are both equally worth checking out."
"2","Definitely inconsistent. The bartender and the manager were both SUPER nice and since I just wanted To Go, told me to head to the bar (I'd been sitting five minutes and the three waitresses milling around doing nothing had ignored me). I went to the bar, was told by a server to move and then 30 seconds later found out that this server would be taking my order. Without remorse, she rang me up, asked me if I wanted my change, and then complained to the bartender that she needed to give me change... IN FRONT OF ME. When the food came out, she practically tossed the box at me and of course, it was the WRONG ORDER. Might come back, might not. But if I do, you better believe I'm having a chat with the manager."
"1","Worse than ever! They did not have formula for our daughter. They did not have formula. Horrible. Also, they sold us a bag of Butterfingers which was missing several of the bars. (Just empty individual packs.)"
"5","The manager and his crew are the best. I personally hate every mechanic I encounter due to their arrogance and poor performance but Hamid and his crew are the BEST I have encountered. Not only they fixed my 09 Jetta but paid my deductible for my warranty. So nothing came out of pocket. Will bring my friends and family to his honest business in the future. \n\nThis review is about six months late and I still have no problems with my car. I don't say corny stuff but thanks Bussy Buggy."
"4","Olde German Schnitzel Haus, our local award winning Germany restaurant, closed at the end of August. \n\nI found no less than three German restaurants, while searching on Yelp, and oddly enough they were all exactly one hour from Hickory: \n(1) \""Berliner Kindl German Restaurant\"" in Black Mountain. (Bookmarked)\n(2) \""The German Restaurant\"" in Yadkinville. (Fantastic!)\n(3) \""Waldhorn Restaurant\"" in Pineville. (Bookmarked)\n\nI have had Waldhorn on my \""to try list\"" seemingly forever, so I headed toward Pineville for lunch.\n\nI had every intention of ordering German sausages, sauerkraut, fried potatoes, and German beer, but they had a dish on the lunch menu that sounded appetizing. It was a veal dish with sauteed mushrooms in a brown gravy atop Sp\u00e4tzle, accompanied by saut\u00e9ed vegetables. This dish sounded good to me so I changed my mind at the last minute. It was delicious, but it was a very plain Jane looking dish, so I didn't take any photos. \n\nI was seated immediately, but it took a good ten minutes for the young male bartender to stop talking golf and NASCAR before he pulled my Spaten lager. When he did get around to his duties, he did a very good job. \n\nNote: Spaten brewery was started in the year 1397, and it is delicious beer! It is also deceptively potent. \n\nI also drank a Spaten Oktoberfest beer, and that was fantastic as well!\n\nI enjoyed Waldhorn, and it was well worth the hour's drive. \n\nWhen I return I will try an assortment of German sausages with mustard, sauerkraut, fried potatoes, and a German beer or two. \n\nWaldhorn Restaurant is highly recommended!"
"4","Good food, good late night, full of Philly Phans!!  What a great place to find  tucked away in the city.  Naturally, I ordered the Philly sub to give it the ol' test.  It passed!  The key is the roll and their roll was nice and fresh.  If you are full of food/beer and want something else to do.. Stroll over to the shuffle board table and give it a spin while you watch the games.  They even have friendly poker games once a week that you can simply just show up and play.  The whole staff is friendly and dont mind striking up a conversation with you.  The only negative side is that the place just isnt that clean.  But if you dont expect the Ritz ahead of time and know just where you are going.  Then you should be fine.  Enjoy!\n\n-Ian M."
"2","Usually really good cappuccinos, and their baked goods are pretty good.  But they need to clean out their toaster and stop burning toast.  And this last time the cappuccino was terrible - bitter, too hot, terrible foam.  I brought it back and not only did the barrista give me excuses about how its so busy in the morning (a ridiculous excuse because we always come in the morning, and it wasn't that busy), and then had the gall to charge me to get a regular drip coffee."
"1","Very disappointed.  I took my 2010 challenger in to have the oil changed and the ultimate wash on Friday.  Saturday afternoon I noticed oil spots under my car, when I lifted it up I found oil dust cover/skid plate transmission and cross member.  I returned to classic car spa right when they were closing, and was told to bring it back first thing Sunday morning and they would make it right.  When I brought it back the technician remembered my car, he told me that it wasn't a leak it was a spill because the oil from the gun came out faster than my car could take it.  He said had tried to clean it up.  The manager left while the technician was explaining what happened and never returned.  They took the car, cleaned up what they could and gave it back to me.  I got the car home and there is still oil I can feel with my hand, the front of the car has smudges or oil/degreaser on the nose and right fender.  I had to rewash the front end and it still smelled of burning oil when I got it home.   They didn't make it right and I regret taking my car to here."
"3","I absolutely LOVE Cirque shows, having seen a couple before (Ovo & Zumanity), so I was really excited when my boyfriend was offered comp tickets for his birthday in Las Vegas. Our seats were perfect, right in the middle about 6 rows up from the stage. I was extremely impressed with the set, as it was beautiful, and the water acts were gorgeous. Unfortunately, I was slightly underwhelmed. I don't know if it was just me, but I found the comedy to be lacking...the clown humour wasn't funny and I actually found it to be pretty boring. I was expecting to see more \""AMAZING\"" acrobatics, but aside from the beautiful diving (that takes talent) and a couple other acts (fire dancers, jumpers) I was really unimpressed. I didn't understand the story they were trying to tell, and some of the scenes were downright confusing. What was with the guy holding the 1-800 sign? Not to mention, I felt creeped out by it, like it was a weird acid trip. Those guys in the red coats are what nightmares are made out of. I love Cirque du Soleil and \""O\"" was a nice way to spend an evening, but overall I'm glad we didn't pay for the tickets. We found ourselves yawning towards the end and unfortunately, we were glad when it ended. Next time, I will see Ka or Mystere!"
"2","2 stars for frozen hot chocolate... yummm\nWaiting time to be seated 30 mins\nWater to be delivered at your table 15 mins\nAnother 15 mins wait to take your orders\n41 minutes wait for the food :( \nFood was so-so, not bad, not that good either.\n\nI only want the frozen hot choco, so I'll just order at the window next time."
"5","I love their rice plates!! The chef also adds a little artistic touch to the food too!"
"4","loved to ambience. great food. average drinks."
"1","I have been to Tao before, though usually earlier in the evening and we liked it enough to go back. Well, that is the last time I will be going there and also the last time I will recommend that anyone else go either. \n\nLike many of the other reviewers I had made a dinner reservation (far in advance) for a Sat night dinner. The best time we could get was 10:15. After waiting in line for the \""reservation check-in\"" we were told they would call us when our table was ready and they gave us a pager. Well wait we did. We didn't get seated until and hour later! What kind of restaurant operation takes reservations and then makes you wait an hour anyway? That is really poor front of the house operation. \n\nFOOD: The Shabu-Shabu Filet was terrible. It tasted like they had left the raw meat sitting out for hours. The green beans we all ordered tasted like they drenched them in fish sauce, and I could tell that they had not changed the oil in their fryer in quite some time as the spring rolls (both appetizer and dessert kind) tasted like rancid oil and were too hard to bite through! Not one person at our table commented on liking their food. \n\nThe wait staff seemed to be attentive but that was only the first time our waiter came to the table. After that time we had to try and find our waiter to flag him down. When it came time to pay and we were obviously done for quite some time, he was nowhere to be found. Even worse, three of us paid to have sparkling water instead of just tap water and when we were about half way done with our glasses, someone actually came around and refilled them with with tap water! If you are going to hire people who can pay attention or at least ask the question, then maybe you should serve your waters in different glasses since there are three options.\n\nAfter our mediocre and ridiculously overpriced meal we went to go to the club upstairs. They came around and gave us stamps at the table that would allow us access without waiting in the long line and without paying. When the first person got to the front of the smaller line he was charged entry for two to get in ($50!!). Immediately we said, \""wait we don't have to pay\"" Instead of being able to credit him back for the charge or just giving him cash, the manager came over and gave him drink tickets instead. He acted like he was being soooo nice by giving him and the girl he paid for a ticket and then a second one each. What, 4 drinks for $50, not including tip?? Geee, thanks so much for the generosity. To top it all off, the club sucks. Cheesy, bad flow and really bad air flow. We decided to go up the Tao Beach instead to get outside and that was better as far as being able to move around and breath, but the cockroaches running around were a bit of a turnoff.\n\nWith all of the choices in Vegas now, this place needs to step up their service and food quality or be replaced."
"3","I don't usually review chains, but $8 hot n ready deep dish pizza is seriously good. And only $8!\nDemand was so high on a Thursday night that they kept running out - the stuff coming out of the oven was literally hot and ready!"
"2","I saw a someone praise this place on Facebook and I started chuckling. My wife asked me to go with her to the melting pot a couple years ago. She was very excited until the food actually came. That's when she said, this isn't what we ordered. I said yeah there is less then 4 oz of meat to share between 2 people. She said, no I meant these are the wrong sauces. I said hang on. We are paying 120 dollars for 2 cups of raw vegetables, 4 oz of meat, and beef stock? She said well your paying for the ambiance. Plus desert is to die for. Desert came, she said Isn't this great and I said we are dipping less then a cup of fruit in chocolate. At the end she said you hated it, didn't you. I said baby I loved being there with you, but I have never paid so much money in all my life to eat every day food and stay hungry. For the same money we could have gone to any number of nice restaurants and actually had a full meal.  My wife laughed and then said yeah your right. It's a great little niche restaurant idea, but once you get past all the hoopla this is place is a huge rip off.  On the plus side, It's a nice romantic place with super dark tables. Cooking your own food gives you plenty of time to sit and talk with that special someone."
"5","My boyfriend made reservations here for my birthday dinner. The view was amazing (at night)  and the food was delicious. We both ordered the surf and turf my lobster was so good and my steak so tender and moist . My boyfriend who usually doesn't like his steaks medium rare ended up finishing my plate!  he said and I quote \"" best steak hes ever had\"" we came at night and the vibe was romantic."
"5","I've had a few cars tinted with these guys. ALWAYS a great job and very professional. Highly suggested!!!"
"4","Very nice place to stay.  Came here with my family as part of a vacation package - we chose the king bed room with pull-out couch for the three of us and so far has not been a hassle.  Love the fact that there is a gas fireplace in the room and a jacuzzi tub.  If it warms up a bit we might venture to the pool and/or hot tub.  Fry's is just up the street and we are buying much of our food and supplies there - the room has a fridge and coffee maker, but no microwave.  \n\nOur neighbors are active but it hasn't been too much of a problem.   The walls are a bit thin but it's to be expected.  Where we are is handi-accessible and I definitely recommend this for those who are limited in their mobility - it has lots of handrails in the bathroom, and has a shower chair.\n\nNice big closet and dresser - loved the fact that they supply two spa robes.  This is a nice place and very low-stress.  The front desk people were exceptionally nice and very helpful in telling us of nearby restaurants.\n\nLastly, the southwestern style is of the room adds to the relaxed atmosphere of the place.  The artwork in the room is similarly southwestern-themed, so it's cheesy but in a good way!\n\nWill definitely stay here again if the chance comes up again :)"
"2","Blanco is not the place to find authentic Mexican food.  The atmosphere is really unique--super trendy and quite dim inside after sundown. The margarita was ok and the food was good, but nothing to write home about. They fill you up on chips and generic salsa to compensate for the smaller portions. \n\nI ordered the vegetable tacos with grilled chicken and black beans. The accompanying carrots and risotto-like rice were very out of place. \n\nThe service was impersonal and we hardly received any attention from our server--not even a single refill on water!  I'll go elsewhere next time I'm craving Mexican fare."
"1","I come to Brillo Box all the time. My friend, who is 28 and us from Turkey was not let in tonight... For dinner and drinks. The guy working the door needs an attitude adjustment and just because a place has been raided in the past, does not mean you don't act like a civilized human being. A Turkish ID that says 28... Should be enough. Shame on you Brillo Box. I am done with you and your awesome food. Get a new bouncer!!!!"
"3","It is the closest sports bar, so when playoff time rolls around I have to get my fix. But wait, I'm a Red Sox fan. Whatever, I went in anyways not really caring for rivalries. I didn't notice an overwhelming New York vibe or anything, just a table full of hooligans in the booth next to us. I was somewhat amused by the company logo upon looking at the menu. Expecting a gangster Yankee theme, it was humbly a chicken riding a buffalo.\n\nOur server was extremely pleasant, although perhaps had her hands full with the table next to us. My beer ran out and sat there arid for some time, whether that means I have a problem or not it was still a slight buzz kill. I began with 6 Wings and then dived into a Skyscraper Burger- which was absolutely delicious! Being one of the largest items on the menu I had to tackle it due to the nature of my appetite. Although pricey, the Burger is probably worth it and the wings were solid. Massive TV's are everywhere, and it is a very comfortable setting... I liked it and will probably go in again for the upcoming season."
"1","I stay here a minimum of three times per year. My last stay, last week, was depressing. Key cards did not work properly ( required repeated insertions in door to get it open) there was no bath mat placed in the bathroom, so I had to use a regulalr towel on the floor. Speaking of regular towels, could they be any rougher? Lots of signs of wear and tear...stains on the couch, scratches on wood and furniture, bed sagging in center. Tiles in shower look skeavy. All of this would have just led to a ho hum, no complaint on Yelp, but what really irked me was my last morning there. I went for an early breakfast came back to my room and neither one of the key cards would work any longer. I was in a huge rush to get packed, check out and make it to a 10 am business meeting. I waited in line, got new key cards, packed and rushed downstairs to check out. Waited in line for 20 minutes while three THE Hotel staff wasted time chatting with people trying to check in at 10am. You see, rather than have one line for check in and one line for check out, which would show organization, they do not do that. So people trying to check in at 10 am, when check in is not until 2pm, have nothing better to do than to chat the front desk staff. Meanwhile, those of us waiting to check out, needing to catch a plane, get to a metting, whatever, just waited. The waiting line quickly became quite long. After 20 minutes, when i finally got to a front desk person and complained about the wait and lack of organized lines, I got the rudest, most disrespectful response ever. So, if you stay there, be prepared for crappy service. I will never stay there again! It is fallen on hardtimes and poorly managed!"
"3","I hate the Vegas club scene.  I also hate the New York and LA club scenes.  I am a simple Midwestern boy.  In the Midwest, you pay the cover ($5) and enter.  There is no judging, no lines, and no red velvet ropes.  I don't think it is up to a club to make me feel unworthy.\n\nOn the other hand, I love to dance and the clubs in Vegas are some of the best places to do just that.  They have the coolest interiors and the best DJs.  So I, like all the other sheep, put myself through the Vegas club torture.  \n\nSorry for the rant... had to put that out there.\n\nROK is in the New York, New York Casino.  You can get VIP entrances for free- Just look for a guy in a suit handing out wristbands or flyers for the club.  Because we had the VIP entrances, we didn't have to wait in line and paid only $10 cover.  \n\nThe club was pretty cool.  The decor was nowhere near as cool as LAX, but the music was great.  They would only play about 1 minute of a song and then would go onto a new one, so you never got tired of what you were dancing to.  They played a really good variety of current hits and your favorites from the last 10 years.  \n\nIt was crowded, but not so bad you couldn't move.  The people were young but not so young as to be annoying.  We had a great time overall."
"2","Scale of 1-10 (single visit):\n5 Food\n6 Service\n7 Atmosphere\n8 Value\n\nBy no means the best sushi.  Though weird as this sounds, grab some creme puffs!  Those are great!  But probably just from Costco.\n\nThey were also unable to figure out when we were done eating (lots of stacked empty plates with no one left eating?), so the payout was slow.  And during lunch table turns should be fast b/c people have to get back to work.\n\nHere's the cool part:  You don't (but you can) order off a menu.  You grab covered food off a conveyor belt that rides around the restaurant.  Apparently this is common in Japan.  I'd never experienced this before.  And the items are cheap ($1-$2), so you kind of just grab what tickles your fancy."
"4","I was craving fruit for breakfast, so when my boyfriend pulls up at a Mexican restaurant, I was a little skeptical. I was wrong! Fully admitting this. The big fruit platter with honey was so fresh and perfect. I had a mango juice that was literally pureed mango. Amazing.  Boyfriend had the Huevos Rancheros. Also mui bueno. I guess this joint was on Food Network for their gigantic burger. Man v.s Food.... That guy. So, funny thing is, his face is plastered all over the restaurant, including on the servers shirts!! It's cool that he could give them the spotlight they deserve!"
"5","Is 180Q for real?! Last time I went out for First Friday I couldn't find their truck and ended up dropping $10 on a grilled cheese at another truck when what I truly wanted was 180Q's wicked brisket mac n' cheese. After walking around a bit I found 180Q parked over at monOrchid. They we're like \""Yo, you guys hungry?!\"" and we were like, \""Yeah, we've been looking for you, but we spent all our money on grilled cheese!\"" To my surprise, one of the gentlemen running 180Q (sorry I don't remember your name dude!) offered us a free sample of their tacos and queso AND hooked us up with some banana pudding from their friend's food truck. Again, is 180Q for real?! Yes, and they're the best.\n\nCustomer-4-Lyfe."
"5","We ate here 12-25-2012. Just now catching up with all my reviews! This place is fantastic. My daughter son in law and I flew into vegas for xmas and met my dad and step mom here for dinner and it was great. I had the beef wellington which was perfect. Everyone else had some kind of cut of steak and they all loved it. Sorry cant get more specific too much time passing! Service was great too."
"3","The prices are a little high and the food is ok. I have had better pizza. The wings where also ok. The people where nice both times we have eaten there."
"5","I am a pizza nut, a fanatic. I melted the broiler in my oven trying to get it super hot to make better pizza. I still remember when it exploded into flames and thinking how fortunate it was that the pizza was just about done anyway. Enough. This is the first pizza place that has impressed me....ever! The attention to simplicity and great ingredients is stunning. Super fine Italian flour, real moz, and a wood fired oven create wonderful pies with magnificent leoparding (tiny blackened spots on the crust). The staff, and owner Rick, are super friendly and know how to turn out exceptional pizzas with crisp light crust. If you are a Pizza Hut fan don't bother; They don't serve meat lover pizzas. \nGo at least once to see what a slice of real pizza, made by real experts, tastes like."
"1","Great Idea - poor execution! Someone needs to look at the systems and food quality then train staff on service and efficiency. Very expensive for lettuce and a few tomatoes. Dressings and marinated chicken kill the nutritional value. It will never last at the rate they are going."
"4","The MGM Grand invited me back to stay for a night after my sub par experience last year.  They'd improved in several aspects since my last stay.  The staff was much more polite this time, consistently, and the check in process ran much smoother, notably.  The hotel is still a massive, sometimes over-crowded behemoth, and the valet service is still incredibly slow, but they definitely impressed me more this time than last."
"1","Ok so the first time we came in this place they were closing. But decided to not tell us, we were the only two in the restaurant and the sushi was obviously end of day sushi.  However, we decided they deserved a second chance.\nToday was the day; my friend and I went in at 1pm. Once again we were the only people in the restaurant.  The server seemed shocked to have customers, and didn't understand why we were entering?\nThere are about eight TVs. All were on. All were muted.\nThe sushi was from who knows when. \nYou could hear a pin drop, again.\n\nWhen two other customers finally showed up after we requested the tab, we tried making eye contact to warn them - no.. just go. It's not worth it.\n\nFinally as we were leaving the server turned on some music.  We decided that it must be a four patron minimum for any ambiance to be initiated.\n\nYou can get the same quality sushi at Fry's in the deli than in this place. \nWe wanted to love it.\nWe gave a a second chance.\nIt got an F again."
"2","It took me more than 20 minutes to get my single to-go order at this location. On a thursday night when there was hardly anyone there this was ridiculous. The food was OK, I've had better Hawaiian BBQ in the valley for less money. At almost ten dollars for the whole meal, it was not worth the money. Fortunately they do have a smaller, less expensive portion that would fill most people up for lunch."
"1","I stopped in here purely for the sake of convenience. My usual go-to tailor is off Flamingo and my go-to shoe repair guy is off Eastern, but Park Avenue Cleaners is a lot closer to my house. So one day on the way home I decided to bring a dress that needed the zipper repaired and a pair of shoes that needed new heels put on.\n\nIt was clear that the guy behind the counter (maybe the owner?) watched me from the moment I parked (in front of the store) and walked inside. He completely, obviously attempted to up-charge me probably because of the following: 1) I arrived in a BMW, 2) my dress was Herve Leger and he commented on the brand and 3) my shoes were Christian Louboutin, which he also commented on the brand. I did not need them re-soled, which is what he tried to sell me, I just needed the little rubber heels replaced, from wear. We went back and forth and he tried to charge me nearly $50. Out of control! \n\nHe wanted $18 just for the rubber heel replacement, when my go-to shoe repair guy (B&L Shoe Repair off Eastern Ave.) charges $10 flat, regardless of what brand the shoes are.\n\nI said thanks but no thanks and walked out."
"3","We sat down on the bar side and was impressed by all the TV screens on every piece of wall area, along with the celebrity photos and memorabilia. It's a nicely designed and decorated pizza restaurant. \n\nThe service is excellent! Our server was friendly, informative, attentive but not overly, and he was great at upselling. \n\nWe had the calamari which is fried in olive oil only. We were told they have a fryer with olive oil dedicated to frying calamari. Calamari was larger and meatier than what I'm used to which was a pleasant surprise. Batter was light and crisp. Would come back for this... \n\nThe clam pizza had slices of some kind of hard cheese (maybe Asiago or Romano) which made it really salty. I could have done without that. Being that was the first time I had white pizza, I don't think I would order it again; I'm a fan of tomatoes \n\nWe also had the Bufala Margherita which was good. I think the Bufala on the pizza changes the texture to be chewy and recommend ordering just the regular even though there are better benefits to having the Buffalo (there is a reference card they give you that tells you how it is lower in cholesterol, fat, and sodium and higher in protein and calcium - I was amazed at that card, my first time seeing it) \n\nAt the end of dinner they give you a tasting of their gelatos. Great idea, as I tasted the Strawberry White Chocolate Cheesecake and had to get it - there were strawberries in it, so it was a fruit based dessert right?! \n\nI really wanted to like it but I prefer Setto Bello better. I will come back for the gelato and calamari."
"3","Keep in mind that I'vd been living in New Mexico for the past five and a half years...\n\nValet parking, a limo pick-up spot and really flippin' fancy schmancy stores. SFS is great if:\n\na) you're broke but need a little kick in the ass to motivate you to go out and make more money\nb) you've been kicked in the ass enough that you're finally making more money and want to show it off\nc) you've never had to worry about money because you've got rich parents/relatives etc.\n\nIf nothing else, it's worth going to check out all the fancy sports cars zipping around the neighborhood or to watch urban princesses bicker over some triffle to remind you that your own problems really are real and that there are children somewhere out there in the world who don't have any couture at all!"
"3","Much better than the frozen variety.  Sort of better than the quick serve shop in the Fashion Mall in Vegas- from what I remember.  This place was just as I was expecting: way crowded at lunch time, over-priced pizza and drinks, and so-so service.\n\nThe pizza I had with wheat crust that included eggplant, roasted red peppers, and goat cheese was pretty tasty.  I guess if you consider that I had a second meal out of the pizza, the price wasn't too bad."
"4","I'm a lunch patron because they're close to my workplace...\n\nWhen I go here, I'm looking for two things:  good food and quick service.  The former is always delivered, the latter, well...mostly, they do get busy.\n\nPersonally, I get the Pork Fried Rice and occasionally hot and sour soup.  Simple dishes, admittedly, but their execution is what impresses me most about Baoding.  When the plate of rice arrives, you can immediately tell that they JUST MADE IT.  No, its not some dish they made a lot of and left under a lamp.\n\nThe soup is always great.  The service is also nice."
"3","Ok.. the pizza here is good... but I don't understand the hype! My friends always want Secret Pizza whenever we go to Vegas.. but WHY... \n\nTo me.. Secret Pizza is just pizza... nothing special.. but if I had to recommend something, the white pizza is the best out of all the other ones I've tried here. \n\nConveniently located in Cosmo for those of you who like Marquee Day/Night club.. I guess it's something you should at least try once. But don't have too high expectations!"
"2","I used to have lunch here all the time, the food for lunch is Ok! It has a huge buffet with a wide variety of Chinese and Japanese food. The sushi is good, the hibachi chicken is decent and the Chinese food is generic. For 10.95$ the variety is good for lunch however I would not recommend this place for dinner. It is very expensive and it has too much going on."
"2","Our stay here was decent, but I don't think we would stay here again.  I was running the rock n roll half marathon so I was thrilled how closely the hotel was located in relation to the finish line, and that was the main draw.  \nWe took the airport shuttle and our driver told us the hotel does not have a designated drop off area for shuttles so we had to be dropped at Harrah's and walk our bags over to the hotel which was a pain.  There were also no real signs directing you from Harrah's.  \nWe knew there was still construction happening so we specifically asked to be in a room that wouldn't have construction views or noise.  Well, we were placed right outside the construction and there was a chute right outside our window that chunks of concrete and building debris were thrown down.  It woke us up at around 7:30-8 on Monday morning and was so loud we were startled out of bed thinking it was an earthquake or something.   \nThere still seemed like other things that weren't completely finished.  The toilet ran for hours after being flushed and there was no info book in our room to reference for check out times, etc.  \nThe location was nice, close to the promenade, Starbucks, monorail, etc.  That's the main advantage I would say."
"2","I went to Hanny's on a Thursday evening for dinner.  They were really busy with events happening downtown.  It took the waitress 30 mins to return to our table to inform us the bar said they had no time to make our appetizer and she didn't know if we'd get it before our dinner.  Another 15 mins later, we finally got our app, followed shortly by dinner.  The people next to us got their app AFTER they finished dinner.  The service was awful, the food mediocre, and the cost over-priced.  I had high hopes, but was disappointed."
"2","Coming back to Vegas, I met with some friends for brunch here. Here and there, they'd boast of this place as though it was a religious experience. However, I beg to differ.\n\nService was decent - fulfilling the bare requirements of refilling my water and taking my order. Other than that, where's the conversation? Better yet, where is the smile?\n\nOnto the food, I had ordered a breakfast concoction comprised of eggs, feta, spinach, and chicken. Pita on the side as well as potatoes, it was decent. The chicken was dried out, while the eggs were flavorless. I had a bite of my friend's breakfast burrito, which was good. However, my other friend's eggs and bacon looked dismal and...limp.\n\nThe one benefit of the Griddle is the location. Conveniently near the 215 and with a large parking lot, the store is easy to get to. The day I came, the doors were opened as to permit brunch fare to be eaten outdoors.\n\nHonestly, other than the convenient location, there's not much bringing me back to the Griddle."
"2","I got Sam's French Toast with a side of eggs and the eggs were fine but the french toast mostly tasted of everything else that was on the grill. I think if there were separate grills for meat vs other items it would've been better. Friendly service though."
"4","Boss:  \""You want to go to a conference in Montreal?\""\n\nMe:  \""Umm, hell yea, I heard there is good food up there!\""\n\nThis place had a line when I got there for lunch on a weekday.  The wait was not that bad, but man it was worth it.  I ordered the smoked meat with...LOTS OF FAT!  Of course, fat = flavor...right?  Well, it was pretty damn good.  I mean, it didn't change my life or anything, but if I lived here, I would probably hit this place up at least once a month.  Cheap, delicious smoked meats.  Sit down, order and make yourself a sandwich."
"1","This place blows!\n\nI always get comps at MGM & Mandalay, but though I'd shell out a few bucks for the Aria just to check it out.  If you have seen the bad reviews, believe them!  Too bad I had a comped room at the Bellagio for three nights and I decided to stay here instead.  What a dummy I am!  Here's my lists of pros & cons:\n\nPros:\n-Nicely designed rooms\n-Awesome bathroom! Shower & tub are together so you can leave\nthe water running in the tub and it will spill over into the shower drain!\n-Blinds open in room upon your arrival (how awesome is that!)\n-Touch-screen remote & plasma TV (thank god most of Vegas now offers more than 2 channels on their TV!)\n-There were like two people in the casino.  I consider that a pro.\n\nCons:\n-dirty, Dirty, DIRTY!  Yes, it's true!  The window was SUPER dirty, but I let it slide because there was a bit of rain on the way there so maybe it was raining in Vegas before I got there.  I think some hairy guy was laying on the bed before I got there because there was some nasty body hair on my comforter.  Eww!  There was also hair in the tub.  What looked like a half eaten Moet & Chandon cork was inbetween the mini-bar snacks, the shower gel they gave had been opened because it had leaked out and you could see gooey hands closed it back up.  Two lights were busted also - the bathroom light (that sucked!) and a vanity light. WTF?! Isn't this casino new? My last gripe about the dirtiness, I swear...I asked for a refill on my cranberry juice from my zombie waiter - he brought one back and I noticed there was some orange pulp on it.  Drank a sip and noticed it tasted like a cranberry orange.  Held it up in the light and there was pulp all in there.  What the hell???  Did this guy give me a used old orange juice glass and refill it with cranberry juice instead?! \n\n-Unhappy staff (Lobby, Front Desk, Dealers, Door people, Hostess, Waiters..anyone else I left out?  Oh yeah, the only nice person was the valet guy!  There were two people checking in who were being helped and I was the only person in line to check in.  Some idiot staff there decided he needed to make a line (for who?!), told me to go behind one of the parties being helped and told me I was \""next in line\"".  I think I had that figured out from the time I stepped in line.\n   \n-Crappy slot machines. I lost 1k in literally about 20 minutes.  Damn you max bet!  There wasn't much variety in machines, which was a bummer.\n\n-Table games:  Douche bag players at tables.  And not only that, they don't know how to play.  I couldn't win at a single table or slot.  The dealers don't even say \""good luck\"" when they hand you the chips because they know you're gonna lose so what's the point?\n\n-Food: Way overpriced for mediocre food.  The buffet was not very good.  There wasn't much to eat.  I came out hungry...at a buffet! They had some crab legs on ice but they weren't very cold.  The shrimp & asparagus was excellent, but that was literally the ONLY good thing they had there.  The desert was just o.k. \n\nAte at their cafe.  $4.50 for a coke, $4 for a coffee and $14 for a club sandwich? Way too pricey! It should have at least been good.  That was probably the worst club I've ever had - how can you make that bad?  Again, I really didn't care for the employees anywhere.\n\n-Zombie staff: The staff outweigh the guests.  There's just too many people working there, I don't get it.  A guy standing in the lobby to tell you to stand in line, an elevator guy checking your key 24 hours a day, random guys standing around by the escalator keeping an eye on the place - they were just EVERYWHERE!  Really irritating!  I was so surprised that no one was even remotely friendly.  Not even a smile.  I'm wondering if Aria is human trafficking or something because these people don't seem right.  Was I on vacation or in prison?\n\nLast con: Parking.  I always do valet in Vegas, but thank god I did because I wouldn't even have a clue where to go. \n\nI think this is a casino that you could go to just to see what it looks like since it's new.  I would definitely not stay here again.  It seemed too far to walk out onto the strip and complicated, so I didn't even bother.  I like to stay at the MGM - the room is decently priced, the location on the strip is excellent, great games and it's clean. \n\nThanks but no thanks, Aria.  Don't blame your lack of guests on the economy, it's your hotel.  Good luck with your sub-par employees, hotel & casino."
"5","I love how I can walk into Lowes and there is always someone that remembers what project we are working on. It is like they remember your face and what room you are on now. Melissa S has been so incredibly helpful with all of our needs! I look for Melissa now when I go into the store because she is so knowledgable about each and every product you have! You need more employees like Melissa working at this location. Thanks for being My Lowes"
"4","Good food,  extremely good value,  a little more spice than I can handle in dishes I wouldn't expect it from.\n\nSlightly disappointed as we had come up to try the naan and it's no longer on the menu. \n\nI'd have given five stars,  but we ordered rice and it never came."
"3","Service is just okay--they are rude short with you. No parking. On a brick road that will have your car shaking the whole time. You will get your car swiped if you aren't careful. The cheese blend is good. The sauce is sweet: not slightly sweet, but sweet. There is a lot of appeal to Fioris because of the sauce. I guess I prefer something savory in my sauce and find the aggravation to make it less worthwhile than Mineo's in Mt. Lebanon"
"4","Michael's is my favorite dessert-type stop in Madison. You see ice cream, gelato, sorbet, and frozen yogurt all over the place. But frozen custard is a superior breed of dairy goodness.\n\nI never get tired of Michael's custard. They offer many mixes and flavors, and each one can quench your cravings. It's pricier than ice cream, but that's because, again, frozen custard is superior."
"1","Check-in was horrible , worst I have ever seen in LV. The managers and the check in people were unconcerned about 30 min to 1 hour check in , and even rude"
"4","As a former Alltel employee, I understand how things work. Stores don't control pricing of plans or phones. So its about customer service. We came in to buy ourselves some new phones. Every staff member we interacted with was kind and professional. They did try to upsell some accessories, which I guess I don't blame them. Overall it was fairly a pleasant experience."
"1","This place is a ripoff. I had a storage unit for 2 years here. When I deceided to give it up they would not prorate my fees when I was told by the staff and manager that they prorate fees. They had no concern for my situation, the staff is very unfriendly. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY."
"5","The search for the elusive cookie butter is what originally led us here.\n\nI am a HUGE Trader Joe's fan/addict, and anytime we make it to California or Las Vegas, this always ends up being one of our first stops on our trips.\n\nFaves here include:\n\n-crunchy cookie butter\n-cookie butter bar\n-speculoos cookies (notice a theme? lol)\n-sea salted chocolate caramels\n-dark chocolate almond laceys\n-dark chocolate edamame\n-cinnamon pita chips\n-beurre meuni\u00e8re popcorn (lemon, thyme, brown butter)\n-cold brew coffee\n-gingerbread coffee (seasonal :( boo)\n\nA tip for Hawaii locals trying to get their hands on cookie butter: you need to go to the farthest Trader Joe's from the strip/downtown area, and get there early (preferably as soon as they open). \n\nLooking forward to our next Vegas trip... I already have my Trader Joe's shopping list ready. ;P"
"1","People please do not waste your money on this place as it is the biggest rip-off in town. Besides charging more than anyone else in town they have no respect for their customers. I am aware there are cheaper places to have my cars smog checked but I always go here because they are close to my house. They CHARGE more, so there is never any waiting. I have taken my cars there for over 10 years and feel that would make me a good and loyal customer. I went there yesterday and my car did not pass the test, the man working there asked me if I recently had my battery changed, I said yes. He said until I put 50 miles on my new battery my car will not pass. Fine, no problem except the test they did would be $13.99 and to get it retested it would ONLY be $10. So now instead of paying $5 more it's going to be $10 more than everyone else in town. I asked if the extra $5 fee could be waived since I am a loyal customer, he said no. I asked if there was someone over him I could talk to. He gave me the number for a Jim or Bill, I can't remember because I was very upset. This guy whom is supposed to be professional was so rude I felt like I was talking to a high school drop-out punk. I asked him if he was really willing to lose a loyal customer who has brought in 2 cars every year for over 10 years over a $5 fee and he said \""YUP\"", not yes, just \""YUP\"" like a no class uneducated idiot. Oh yes, I also said they should post a sign warning customers about if they had a new battery installed their car would not pass. The bully owner or manager replied \""We don't have to post any signs\"". Really snotty. I know they don't have to post a sign, but it would be a nice courtesy for the customer, but wait , then they wouldn't be able to rip off the customer. Also if you use  a credit card or debit card there is a $1 SURCHARGE. This place cannot find enough ways to rip off the customers. I am disputing this charge with my credit card company, I so hope I win, not for the money, just the principle. I am not going back for my $10 retest, I would rather go elsewhere and drive a little farther and pay $15 then give them another penny of my money. Whatever happened to DON'T PASS DON'T PAY."
"1","US Today needs to have its head examined. Had a brunch buffet for $25 which featured really, compared to Bellagio and the superb Cosmopolitan, very few choices. Dry brisket and sausages. Seafood bar without seafood. Had a small cup which had a handful of gamey shrimp and crab pieces in it. Needed a big mug of green tea to wipe my mouth clean after that. Desserts were equally a mixed bag. Gelato was fine, but forget the dry little chocolate mousse pieces or even worse the over sweetened pecan tart. More green tea was needed. Best part of the buffet, other than the green tea, was a raw fuji apple. Imagine that... and they didn't even have to cook it at the hotel. Forget the hype and avoid this culinary waste space."
"1","Spend a little more and take a taxi. Just rude. Tried to tell us that even though we paid for hotel pick up that we had to walk 3 hotels away. We knew more about the events going on than they did. No accountability."
"3","Looks like a lot of my fellow reviewers will disagree but I found Roka Akor to be all style no substance. Don't get me wrong the food was good, but I've definitely had better sushi at places that are much less expensive. Making cool designs on my plate with the sauce does not make it worth the extra money. I went because I had a Groupon. I would never go there at full price. Sitting at the bar and being able to watch the cooks was nice. They have an open kitchen right there in the dining room. And the cocktails we ordered were very good (and pretty strong!). \n\nI wouldn't necessarily discourage anyone from going to Roka Akor, but I personally think it's too pretentious and you could definitely find better sushi place in the Scottsdale area."
"2","I get that this place is a lounge and not a club but that being said, it's a LOT smaller than I expected. For a small lounge, you'd think it'd be packed. No, it was pretty dead when I went and based on everyone else's reviews, it's pretty dead on more than one occasion. \n\nI guess being dead serves us well considering we had a group of 15 with 8 of them being guys. We had no problem getting the guys in but I'm guessing the club figured, better to have guys in the lounge than no people at all. \n\nI guess I was expecting a lot considering it's Vegas and everything is always overdone here. I like the REVOLUTION sign that spells LOVE on the other side but honestly other than that, I don't think I'd come back here again."
"1","The food is simply horrible. It lacks flavor, probably due to the lack of it being fresh and seasoned properly. If you want a fried item then it is the same as any other fried food at any other place. The service is ok, nothing special. It is always busy whenever we drive by and it is a mystery. If you want fresh, perfectly seasoned and cooked food I would suggest chipotle."
"2","Industry is right down the street from my office, so it's a frequent destination for lunches, happy hours, and the like.\n\nUnfortunately, it consistently fails to deliver in a number of ways, including:\n\n1. Service is always sloooowwww. On occasion, it's unbearably slow. My most recent lunch, it took over an hour to bring out dishes... and we almost just walked out.\n\n2. Twice now at lunch, I've ordered the chicken breast entree. BOTH times, only after waiting for everyone else's food has started coming out, they've come by to tell me that they were out of chicken breasts. Each time, I instead opted for a salad -- for which, surprisingly enough, they happened to have chicken breasts!\n\n3. They upcharge for drinks to be served neat and claim this is a standard practice.\n\nIn total, I'm thinking my coworkers and I will start heading elsewhere for lunches and happy hours in the future. This place is pretty disappointing."
"2","Here for the very first time with my son.  The stylist asked what we wanted done on my son's hair.  it is on the longer side in a surfer style cut.  I requested a trim and re-shape of only a half inch, no more, he even confirmed showing me how much he would cut off by the measurement to which I agreed.  What I watched fall on the floor was at least an inch, maybe a little more.  Other salons I have been to (in San Diego) take their time with my son's hair, this cut took all of 5 minutes.  The customer service is pretty lacking as well.  I informed my son that he is going to have to graduate to a big kid salon, we most likely won't be coming back here."
"5","I was here this past week while visiting. The food was superb. The seared tuna was amazing-the best I've had anywhere. The scallops were also excellent. Appetizers were delicious. The restaurant is beautiful, dimly lit, and very relaxed. Our server, Amanda, was great-really knowledgeable and helpful. Lookinf forward to my next trip to Pitt. to come back here."
"4","If the main casino isn't quiet enough for you (though that's unlikey!), head upstairs to this sports bar. There is gaming at the bar and a nice selection of draft beer. There are also tables for easy viewing of the many TVs. You must try the $1 cheese pizza slices, which are only available when the kitchen is open (weekends only unless during game season I think). The pizza is great!"
"5","I had always heard that paying for advertising online was like sinking money in a hole. Wow was that wrong. Eric at LeRiche Marketing showed me how I can spend a little on every click, and really build my client base. Just because I had to spend the money on Adwords, did mean I didn't make far more. Eric thanks for opening my eyes to one of the best investments I'd every make in my business!"
"2","Got together with Mike C. to go out to a Thanksgiving Buffet today.  We tried for Golden Corral down the street in Gilbert but the line was way outside, so we came up here where there was also a wait, but shorter.  It was good, as always, but there were some negatives this time:\n\n*  The soups:  There was an ordinary Corn Chowder, a weak Cream of Broccoli, & ordinary Chicken Noodle.  They should have done better than this for Thanksgiving.\n\n*  There was no cottage cheese.  (They don't always have it, but at these prices they should have some today.)\n\n*  There was turkey, but breast meat only & no dressing!\n\n*  Over at the dessert bar there was no hot fudge (& it looked not as if it had run out, but rather that they just didn't offer any today).\n\n*  There were no sundae cups.  I had to go over & get a soup bowl to make a sundae.\n\n*  There was Hot Lava Cake (or \""Hot Fudge Cake\"" I think they call it here), but it was sorely lacking in lava!\n\nThus, it's down to 2 Stars for this restaurant that wasn't as good as it should have been for the money.\n\nThanksgiving Buffet $12.99/$12.49 Sr."
"3","This place is all about convenience.\n\nIt is convenient to grab a drink while friends are waiting in line.\nIt is convenient to get a refill as you walk from hotel to hotel.\nTherefore (no suprise) it is conveniently over priced.\n\nI appreciate the craft beers - some of my favs on tap, Fat Tire, Mirror Pond, Moose Drool. And I do appreciate that you can people watch like CRAZY at this spot, but I wouldn't stay and hang out. I will however be grabbing a drink ever so often as I stroll by."
"5","Not high maintenance but sure enjoyed my one experience here. \n\nI had gotten a gift certificate at my bridal shower. I chose the weekend before my wedding. I got the \""Pamper Me\"" package @ $135- salt glow & steam, hot herbal wrap, and 55 minute massage- two hours of bliss- this meant no wedding worries of any kind what-so-ever (I know all brides can relate). It was just what I needed in order to get prepared for my one special day. I was relaxed, clean, shiny, and new. For a goal-oriented person who  wants to mark things off the To-Do list- this is major.\n\nThe staff is very nice. Very tranquil setting. The music is soft. The lights are dim. Tips are put in an envelope at the front desk.  \n\nI would gladly get this package again. I would highly recommend this day spa- they will treat you very well."
"4","I love this place.  My friends and I try to have a 'girl's night out' once a month and we frequent Radio Maria because of the delicious cuisine and the atmosphere.  It is relaxing and has several conversation pieces.  The service is spectacular.  This is one of my favorite local spots to dine in Champaign"
"3","Cafe Luna in theory has much going for it - trendy interior, good location in campustown, free parking, and an excellent wine list. That said, it seems that their tapas style menu is still needs a lot of work for the prices they are asking. I've been twice - each time fried foods have been either undercooked or soggy, cold dishes served at room temperature, the cds being played skipped. All of that said, the staff seemed distracted - which I could forgive if there were more than five people in the restaurant. I am giving it three stars as the menu is at least interesting and the selection of wine and spirits excellent. Otherwise, it would be a two star selection."
"3","I try to like this place real bad since it is in my neighbourhood and its te only breakfast offering nearby. The food is just generic and they dont use real eggs. It tastes like eggs in boxes. Not sure what the name is but I have bought it in the store and tried it. \nit is a fun no pretentious place and the staff treats you well. I hope the menu gets more creative."
"4","Food: 4\nService: 4\nAtmosphere: 3. Cramped in a strip mall (which is of course typical in LV.). It is located in the same strip mall as another popular Japanese place, Raku.\n\nFIRST IMPRESSION and ORDERING\nAs we stood waiting for about maybe 15-20 min, we peeked over to the table of 4 who were eating on a table smack right next to the entry door where everyone was standing & waiting. We saw that the fried rice looked a tad greasy and so did the ramen broth. My dinner companion gave me that look of \""hmmm\"" and I said \""I guess we'll just try it since we're already here\"". We were curious to compare this to our usual Ramen Dojo (San Mateo, CA).\n\nWe ordered one tonkotsu $6.95 (+egg $1.50  and corn $0.50), one shoyu ramen $6.95 with extra chasu (+4 pieces, $2.50) and one kimchi fried rice $6.95 (hoping this would be less greasy than the regular fried rice and it was slightly less common in the Ramen place).  Having not eaten lunch that day, we were huuungry and ready to devour our order as soon as it arrived. First impression: noodles presentation looked neat and mouthwatering; the ingredients were neatly arranged on top and the bowl of ramen looked quite appetizing. Especially with 2 hungry stomachs impatiently waiting to devour them. LOL. \n\nThe broth didn't appear as greasy as my earlier glance at the previous table.  There was a curious black ring around each of the chasu (more about this later) that's usually not present in the other ramen's place chasu piece.  Interesting, we thought.\n\nThe fried rice still looked a tad on the greasy side by the shines it showed. But in all fairness, I haven't ordered Japanese fried rice in a ramen place for some time. Maybe they all look like that.\n\nNow on to the fun part.\n\nFOOD\nThe broth on the tonkotsu ramen was delish. Slightly on the lighter side compared to Ramen Dojo, but it was still good. One big difference that made Ramen Dojo's broth more 'hearty' and tasty was the addition of chicken bits in their broths. If you like a lighter version of Tonkotsu broth, you will like Monta's version better.\n\nThe shoyu broth was light yet had a lot of flavor. \n\nThe tonkotsu bowl came with thin noodles. We both were very curious how good (smooth) this thin noodle would be. While not as 'smooth' as some of the other thin ramen noodles we've tried in Japan, we were pleasantly surprised at how smooth and tasty it was. So, thumbs up here.\n\nThe noodles in the shoyu bowl was also pretty good. It is the yellow, thicker, curly kind; of course heavier than the one in the tonkotsu bowl, yet not super-heavy.\n\nAs for the curious black ring around the chasu, as you probably have guessed, it is the pork skin. The skin itself was a real thin strip with a very thin layer of fat underneath it.  Including this skin gave the soup broth an extra flavor and aroma that distinguished it from other ramen's place broth. It was probably also why the half-finished ramen bowl we peeked earlier looked slightly greasier. I don't typically see this pork skin included in other ramen shop. This is a plus for the broth. The slightly greasier broth didn't quite happen as much in my bowl. 'cause I like to scrape off the fat under the pork skin. LOL. Another thumbs up!\n\nThe last dish which was the kimchee fried rice ($6.95) was yum, though I still think it could be done with slightly less oil.  Unlike the rice bowl-sized portion that it often comes in, this fried rice came in a rounded square plate of the size that could've been a meal by itself.\n\nSERVICE\nService was friendly, efficient and brisk without making us feel rushed. But we did devoured our meal super fast and left quickly as a courtesy to the long lines of people waiting.\n\nTwo thumbs up for this place.\n\nANECDOTAL COMMENTS & OBSERVATIONS (mostly rhetorical)\nWhy is it that most ramen house has the most 'house rules' posted on their outside window? No outside food. No outside drink. No tacos? (seriously, this place has a picture of tacos with a cross on it and Japanese writing)."
"3","This is the nearest place for me to buy Boba when I feel like having one. Not bad. It takes a very long time for them to make one shake. I went to Smith's to buy a few things I needed, went back to the cafe and they were not yet done.  Their swirl potato chip on a stick is really good. I think they are over priced. Overall,  I still go there to buy my boba."
"3","I went last night to see Dave Dresden play. I really think they needed a Gay mans touch when they were designing. The sound system was OK at best. Drink prices weren't too bad lke you would expect from a new \""trendy\"" scottsdale club/bar. Unless you were in the not so VIP VIP section there is hardly anywhere to put your drink. I did like the Bathroom except for the puke in the urinal......ewww\nOne positive thing was all of the lights were LED's so you could say this play was going \"" green\"". All in all I will go back again depending on who is playing thier but wouldn't otherwise go to have a good time."
"1","Go to other Radio Shack! This Radio Shack its ok but other ones are better."
"1","Wife and daughter ate here and got food poisoning. They had the shrimp lo mein. Beware!"
"4","This wasn't a word-of-mouth situation, I was simply surfing the net to find something similar to LA's Roscoe's chicken and waffles and found this tiny spot squeezed in downtown Phoenix. I wasn't expecting anything impressive, but Lolo's took me by surprise. I didn't care much about the presentation on the plates but the food was tasty, well-seasoned especially what I ordered the fried catfish with scrambled eggs/cheese, i'm not a cornbread person but it was offered on the plate and it was good. The atmosphere was great and the service there is on point, they were coming by the table making sure everything was ok. I went on Sunday early afternoon, so i'm not sure how it is on a Saturday. One thing for sure, you won't be disappointed. The price is also very reasonable."
"1","I rarely write reviews so for me to sign up and write a review means it was THAT BAD!  Where to start...I paid over $40.00 for an oil change and upgraded car wash-when it was all said and done, the interior of my car was not clean, the side door panels hadn't been wiped off at all and my car started leaking some fluid. The mechanic kept trying to get me to pay for extra services...he would say, \""I just noticed one thing...\"" then when I didn't want to pay for that \""thing\"", he proceeded to notice another \""thing\"" and another \""thing\"". Additionally, I noticed scratches on the outside of my car that I hadn't noticed before and my son witnessed one of the employees flashing gang signs. Needless to say, even when my car was leaking fluid after my visit, I wasn't about to take my car back...NOT EVER."
"3","I love the Ohio.  It's the kind of hellhole where you can watch a prostitute sing \""like a virgin\"" on karaoke night, and see old dudes in satin jackets with bar logos on them get in fights.\n\nClassy."
"1","The customer service at this store is horrible. I went in yesterday because I was having trouble with my iPhone. I walked up to an employee at the Genius Bar and told him what was going on, he looked at his iPad and told me I'd have to come back in 3 hours so someone could look at it for me. I was astonished because there was at least 5 employees standing in a circle talking amongst each other none of which were helping any customers. Needless to say, I turned around and walked right out. Went to T-Mobile instead and experienced the best customer service. Disappointed with Apple and I probably will never buy another one of their products."
"3","I know this is a rare 3 star review for this place and I will preface it by saying it is the only Las Vegas buffet I have ever been to, so I have nothing to compare it to, but enjoyed the experience.\n\nI went here for dinner while wandering along the strip one night and I thought it was your typical buffet with a wide variety of options that weren't gourmet but still good.  I think the key is to choose the right options.  The crab legs were awesome and totally worth the $20 since I probably ate $30 of legs alone.  Other favorites included prime rib, mashed potatoes, and spicy tuna rolls.  Salad bar was just OK and so were the desserts.\n\nThis is a really good deal if you are hungry! The atmosphere is pretty tacky but it is within the Imperial Palace so that's to be expected."
"2","My wife and  I were looking forward to dinner at Emily's as it finally filled the space that was Cafe Ted, which for years was one of our all time favorites.  The only real positive was the space which was nicely done,\nBut with an odd grouping of tables - mostly six or eight tops?\nTo start, our server did not know anything about the menu.  My wife ordered a glass of wine, and it was the smallest pour I have seen in a restaurant.  She is a small person, but her chicken with corn and arugula was so small she headed for our fridge when we got home.  My 40 cloves of chicken was good but two chicken thighs for $22 was way over priced.  Also there was confusion with the waiter as to what else came with it. -  a small portion of bread or potatoes and beans?  When finished we asked for the desert menu and was told they had no deserts but we should look at the breakfast menu?\nThe menu is mostly interesting, but a lot of work needs to be done with the servers, the portions and total execution.  We hope they improve to the level of Cafe Ted and we will be regulars."
"2","The food quality has worsened a lot in recent months. Must be a new chef. Almost every dish has less taste and less meat. Too bad."
"1","By far the worst pizza I've ever ate (well we tried to eat some of it). It was so bad I gave the whole pizza to my dad who usually eats everything. Although he managed to garburate it, he himself told me it was one of the worst things he had ever eaten. The cheese felt like rubber, the sauce had an after taste, the dough was dry. On top of it all it was the most expensive pizza I've even bought.\n\nNever again!"
"5","Don't let the line scare you they are very quick with the food preparation, and I love the recharge bar concept."
"5","This place is awesome we spent most of our time in Vegas at O'sheas, they have blackjack tables that play with a single deck and 10.00 minnimum which is hard to find. the crowd here is laid back and fun.. and of course the BEER PONG!! how can you pass on this place i plan on coming back over and over."
"3","Great food crappy service and they tried to over charge us for 2 drinks wow!! I was shocked how our waitress kept walking passed us we had to ask 2 other people to help just to get place our order and get drinks."
"3","Restaurant Week Meal #6 (Dinner for $50.13):\nAppetizer: Baby Iceberg Salad OR Australian Kobe Beef Carpaccio\nEntree: Charred Bone-In Filet Mignon\nSides: Jalape\u00f1o Creamed Corn AND Parmesan Potato Gratin\nDessert: Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar\n\nAside from the Restaurant Week menu, my friend and I decided to get the foie gras terrine since we both love foie gras and another ingredient that comes with it (Nutella!!!).  Charlie Palmer's RW menu is pretty limited and the only portion of the meal that you can choose different options was the appetizer.\n\nHudson Valley Foie Gras Terrine (regular menu):\nNutella, raspberry spaghetti, black mission figs and Texas toast. The terrine was perfectly smooth and creamy which is why it worked so well with the Nutella.  The warm Texas toast just makes the terrine smoother and creamier.  The raspberry spaghetti lacked flavor - it added color to the plate and that's about it. The figs added texture. 4/5 \n\nAustralian Kobe Beef Carpaccio:\nCame with truffle salad. The salad would've been great had it not been extra salty.  The carpaccio itself was excellent...the salad ruined it! 3/5\n\nCharred Bone-In FIlet Mignon:\nCame with bone marrow flan and Port Wine reduction.  The bone marrow flan was good. We always gets our steaks cooked medium-rare...we got rare and the thing was still mooing. I'll eat a steak as long as it's not a hockey puck but if you're a steak place shouldn't you be able to cook medium-rare? 3/5\n\nJalape\u00f1o Creamed Corn and Parmesan Potato Gratin:\nThese sides were really good. The creamed corn wasn't spicy at all for having jalape\u00f1o. The gratin was delis and the melted parmesan on top was great. 4/5\n\nChocolate Peanut Butter Bar:\nServed with caramel ice cream, and chocolate sauce. I don't like peanut butter and chocolate together but that's just a matter of personal preference. The ice cream was good and I finished it then gave the friend the half of my peanut butter.  I mean, the peanut butter wasn't too bad since it wasn't really that pronounced - I was just not in love with it to finish it. 3/5\n\nThe night we went, there was an event (some business mixer) and no hostess was there so we were quite confused. The service was quite bad. I asked first server that came to our table for the RW menu and he said he'd get it but he never came back. We were waiting for somebody to come to our table again but that took 20 minutes! Second server came to our table asking us, \""are you guys ready to order?\"" uh...it's quite difficult to place an order if we don't know what's on the menu! My patience left and ate somewhere else."
"1","I called this location today looking for pricing information for mailboxes and a gal had answered the phone... She sounded quite flustered and said \""I am with a customer so if you call back in 5 mins or stop in the store I can give you information then\"" one thing that you NEVER do is make any customer feel as though they are not as important as the customer that they are currently helping. I called the location on Tropicana and found better results and will be taking my business there.\n\nScratching this location off my list."
"5","Possibly the best food bargain outside of a down-market casino in Las Vegas!\n\nThey don't have In-N-Out Burger in Chicago, where I'm from, so I always try to stop here when I'm in Vegas.  The food is really fresh, including hand-cut french fries.  Avoid this place on the weekends and during lunch, however; it gets really crowded."
"5","When my favorite stylist, Genevieve, decided to take a sabbatical I was nearly in tears. See, I'm kind of a perfectionist when it comes to my locks so I have serious trust issues. But after a bit of research, I decided I'd see Deanne, a stylist I'd met at personal gatherings and who always seemed amazing. Now it took a bit to get in because she was just returning from maternity leave AND she's awesome, but boy was it worth the wait! \n\nFirst, I have crazy long hair after birthing two baby boys in two years. And by crazy long I mean to-my-booty long. So there's that. Next, I color it purple, but not too purple, but still noticeably purple. I'm totally a stylist's dream come true (ha!). Most just try and rush to get me done (even though I always mention my long hair during scheduling), and I rarely get the special perks (like a relaxing shampoo). But Deanne says the heck with that! \n\nDeanne did everything TOP NOTCH. She took the time to check out my pictures and discuss my color. She took the time to apply my color incredibly thoroughly and never once made me feel bad about how long my hair is. Then came *the shampoo*. I got the royal treatment ... literally. She not only shampooed/conditioned me up, but I saw her apply a special serum during my DIVINE SCALP MASSAGE. Then came my hand massage, which was the best I've ever received at an Aveda salon (and I've hit up a few in Phoenix). \n\nWhen we got down to the cutting business, she cut off just enough (for me, it was a solid 4-5 inches). She didn't take the liberty of knowing what's best for me, as some stylist do. I hate that! Then, she gave me a REAL blow-out (not any of this pansy stuff) and proceeded to dry cut my hair. This was the missing link all along! I didn't even know it. See, I'm a big hair kinda gal, but I have semi-fine hair, so with the layers I love, I sometimes lose volume. BUT DEANNE FREAKIN' NAILED IT. I've seriously never loved my haircut this much. So if you like that feeling, go see her!"
"4","Very good sushi, prices are a bit high but I'm not complaining.  I'll be back :)"
"3","Tucked in the corner of Greenway and Tatum, sits The Corn Flower.  I went in for lunch, very simple setup with a friendly staff.  I ordered the chili renello and an empanada.   It was a pretty small amount for the cost you pay for a chili renello.  Just one with a red sauce on top and a side of rice.  Nothing much to the rice.  The chili renello was good but not really filling.  The empanada that I tried was the chicken mole, tasty for sure.  I think the empanadas was the highlight of the lunch.  May go back and try some other items.  It's worth checking out due to the variety of empanadas they have that you can take home and bake or eat there."
"3","I loved this theatre!!! its is nice and spacious. also very clean. its a bit old compared to other theatres in vegas, and the 3D sucks. so old school. the reason why I also love this theatre is they always do media screenings for movies, and I get to see them thru go fobo. that's the reason why I don't mind spending money on their expensive not so good popcorn and soda"
"5","Nice place and very friendly staff. The girl taking my order was really helpful and sweet"
"2","I really wanted to like this place, but came for lunch and was very, very underwhelmed. If you want revolving sushi definitely consider Sushi Station instead. \n\nRolls: Too much rice, all the crab was fake and overpriced.\nWhat really bugged me was that the majority of their specialty rolls were just rolls with FRUIT on top of them (mango, kiwi, strawberries) for $1 more. I'm no expert but I'm pretty sure I'd get sick if I ate that type of combination. \n\nFish: Tried the salmon nigiri, and it was alright for $2. The fish wasn't funky tasting but it was also cut very VERY slenderly. For that reason I would not buy that again. \n\nService: Average. The waitress kept asking me if I was okay, probably because I simply didn't like anything on the belt so just watched the food pass for about 20 minutes.  Very awkward situation. \n\nThe bill wasn't that cheap, the food wasn't that good, and I will not be back. If you know anything about good sushi you'll agree."
"5","I first discovered this amusingly named business when I visited the Edinburgh Farmers Market and they had a stall which was giving away small pieces of cooked beef, and from that moment I was hooked.\n\nThis business knows thier beef about beef - and it really shows. I bought some mini steaks and sausage from their stall and it was some of the nicest meat I had ever tasted.\n\nI also know that they do a whole host of other meats,all of which are the same high quality as the beef."
"4","Second time I stayed at the Aria was for NYE this year. The table minimums have gone up quite a bit. On the plus side, it keeps the crowds out. But on the down side, I don't want to play $5 chips at Roulette at noon. Despite it being a holiday weekend, I could still find tables at MGM going down to $10, even at night.\n\nThe hotel is nice, but again, my room at MGM Grand is nicer. The Aria room had a bunch of issues. The minibar fridge was broken all weekend so all drinks were hot. We left our room for 7 hours during the day and returned to a dirty room - room service hadn't been picked up and it hadn't been serviced at all. They send someone to clean up finally, but they never refilled the water bottles. Later that night, we call and say, hey we need those waters. They say, that's a separate dept. that fills the minibar and they also didn't do their job. And as a result, to get a bottle of water, we had to pay $30 at room service instead of $10 in the minibar. It was annoying.\n\nThe beds are very comfortable. The casino itself is nice and attracts a nice crowd.\n\nBut I still prefer MGM Grand. I never encounter weird problems like those described above and my room is actually nicer at MGM Grand."
"1","Me and my wife stopped by the place because of a 20 dollar groupon that we bought because we were checking out that sweet theatre next door. So we went to there cafe. After being seated we were ignored for a good hour. Even trying to flag anyone down was impossible. The waiter just walked by us as if we weren't there. Finally a bus boy took our order. Salad bar was good. Then they messed up on my check and charged me full price on my card. Completely ignoring my groupon. I will never come here again. No wonder there so dead inside."
"3","I've made plenty of bad decisions here.\n\nHave you ever been somewhere where it means nothing, but somehow, means everything? I like coming to Maz. They don't have a good selection of beer. Or drinks. They don't have good pool tables. There are plenty of shady things that go on here. But still I find myself here every once in a while; generally I'm in a really crappy mood, or I'm feeling to good to go home and too mashed up to go anywhere else."
"5","FAQ:\n\nQ: WOOOOOOO VEGAS!!!!!!!\nA: VEEEEGAS!!!!!\n\nQ: I AM SOOO DRUNK!!!!\nA: ME TOO!!!\n\nQ: I AM STARVING!!!!!!!\nA: SO FUCKING STARVING!!\n\nQ: ISN'T THERE AN ICE CREAM HAPPY HOUR AT THE IMPERIAL PALACE?\nA: ABSOLUTEY! LET'S DO IT.\n\nQ: OH. MY. GOD. IS THAT A CHIPOTLE!?\nA: CHIPOOOOTLE!!!!\n\nFYI ... So, we stopped at this super-conveniently-located Chipotle (delicious Mexican fast-food in case you're unable to read the reviews below) for lunch. What? Don't give me that look. It's Vegas. You're supposed to be drunk by lunch.\n\nThis is the only Chipotle I've seen in a food court setting and trust me (and see my reviews), I've been to a lot of Chipotle restaurants.\n\nMaybe there's a mini-Chipotle at an airport. I haven't been to enough airports."
"4","Decided to check this place out after reading the reviews on Yelp. It was really easy to find on the outside corner of the Paris Hotel. We got there around 3pm for a late lunch and didn't have to wait. Our server was really great and offered a lot of good suggestions, some of which we decided to try.\n\nUpon her recommendation I ordered the turkey and brie crepe since it seemed like something you don't see on an everyday menu. It looks small when you get it, but it was very rich and filling and I didn't even finish it even though I was sooooo hungry. The arugula salad they put on the top balances the richness of the cheese out nice, so overall I thought it was a very simple, yet sophisticated dish. My friend had ordered the grilled chicken and spinach crepe and it was tasty too. \n\nAgain, on our waitresses recommendation, we decided to share the vanilla creme brulee and raspberry crepe for dessert. I wasn't too blown away by this dessert and felt it sounded better on paper than it did on my palette. The raspberry sorbet I felt was the best part, but the vanilla creme in the crepe wasn't to my liking. \n\nI also ordered the Sugar Factory Cappuccino, which is made with white chocolate, and it was huuuugggee! It was sooo delicious though and I was sad I was so full I couldn't finish it. I would come back just for this.\n\nOverall, I think they have an amazing selection of desserts, it was just so hard to decide. I would definitely want to come back just to try some of the other things on the menu. \n\nThe candy shop next door also awesome with a lot of cute candies, clothing and miscellaneous stuff with the cute Sugar Factory logo."
"4","Nightclub:\n\nThe venue is on the small side, I felt really cramped walking around and especially trying to get a drink. It looked like there was just the one bar, and it line was 4 customers deep all the way around the bar. BUT all us girls in our group got free drink wristbands so that was cool, and it bumps up my review 1 star haha.\n\nI enjoyed the music and had a good time on the dancefloor."
"1","Small and not enough room. Avoid this place if you're bringing a whole team. Last resort."
"5","Amazing service ... Quality to the tee!!! I will never go anywhere else live the house and and I'm always treated like family verses just a client !!"
"2","I liked the show (see separate review), but I was very disappointed with the gift shop.\n\nI found the selection just a bit disappointing.\n\nI finally settled on getting a silver charm for my wife's charm bracelet. We specifically asked if it was Sterling Silver, and we were told that it was. The receipt indicated it was as well.\n\nWhen we got back to our hotel on the other side of the strip, we found out that the bag that it was in was marked \""pewter.\""\n\nWe called as soon as they opened the next day to find out what the deal was, and we were told that a manager would call us back with an answer. The call never came, and we're pretty sure that the message was never passed on.\n\nWe ended up going back to the store late that evening to return the charm after buying a replacement gift at another store. The store was hesitant to take it back, insisting that it was real silver. I was insistent though. By this point, I trusted their word about as much as you'd trust a Cozumel street vendor's word that it was silver."
"5","One of the best restaurants in Las Vegas. NEVER a bad meal here. I was in Vegas in April and we dined here as usual and then again last week. We will be back in Vegas at least 3 more times in the summer and will dine here all 3 times. It's just that good!!"
"3","As soon as I saw the pictures of the OMG chocolate chunk cookie I knew I had to try this place! Luckily we stumbled upon their happy hour (9-close everyday) with $6 items. We ordered\n\n1) INTOXICAKE DRINK (5 stars)- chocolate flavored vodka with marshmallow. I LOVED THIS DRINK. Chocolate + Vodka?? Absolutely worth the $6. This I can have over and over and over. Did I mention it was chocolate vodka? Enough said!!\n\n2) WAFFLE FRIES dusted with cocoa and chili powder and chili mayo for dipping (4stars) - this was delicious, but absolutely not worth $6 b/c the amount was ridic. You get like 10 waffle fries. I suppose it's worth trying once, but I wouldn't get it again.\n\n3) OMG CHOCOLATE CHUNK COOKIE ($5)  with the option of dark chocolate or milk chocolate with walnuts - (NO stars). Also, if you want it on the plate with fancy side garnishes it will cost $12, but if you just want the cookie it's $5. I chose the milk chocolate option and was disappointed that the cookie was pretty tasteless and not to mention BURNT all around the edges. I literally took one bite and left the rest alone b/c it wasn't worth the calories. \n\n4) ONION RINGS (2 stars) - 6 or 7 onion rings for $6. No - not only were these not great, they were pricey. \n\nOverall I give this place 3 stars b/c their prices were steep and tiny portions. I would however return for the intoxicake drink. That drink alone is 5 stars."
"2","I have been here on two different occasions, I was not impressed either time.  Almost didn't go back the second time, but thought I would give them a second chance.  Place was dirty both times, food was OK, no came to my table and didn't know that if I wanted a drink, it was serve yourself.  Maybe it wasn't serve yourself, but others did and there was no one around to stop them.  Will not be going back."
"4","This along with XS are my favorite clubs in Las Vegas. I would give this place five stars if it wasn't for the funky layout. Right when you enter you have to walk up this flight of stairs that will make you tired if you aren't moderately fit. \n\nThe cool thing is that there are several floors that play different music, and a pool room that is more of a lounge area to chill. More rooms means easier to find people as long as your have reception. When this place gets crowded though, get ready to fight through people since most of the floor space is not open grounds where you can just squeeze through people. \n\nGuys...be smart and buy your pre-sale. I know, I know...you're a cool guy with LOTS of girlfriends and you get in free to clubs ALL THE TIME...stop being an idiot and just buy a pre-sale. Now you don't have to be at the whim of the females and you can pretty much just walk into the club since the pre-sale line is pretty short. Also, the tickets are cheaper."
"3","THE MONEY WE SAVED ON GAS WAS SPENT ON SNACKS INSIDE\n\nGas was a little bit cheaper at this station ($3.91/gallon) and it was within ten miles of the car rental facility so we stopped here for a final fill-up before returning the vehicle.  Of course, the first pump we stopped at wasn't accepting credit cards at the moment. We reparked on the other side of the station and filled up. About the same price we pay at home - glad we didn't have to do much driving while we were in Vegas!\n\nLots of snacks and goodies inside. We bought one final soda to drink before the security line in the airport. Also, I asked the ladies at the register if I could fill my water bottle with ice and they said yes. Very nice. :)"
"4","Cheap and yummy. Their crust is on the thinner side (not a bad thing) and I personally love their all-veggie option. The garlic knots are flavorful and chewy. For the price, it's definitely good. Not particularly fast so I wouldn't recommend showing up with the intention of grab and go.\n\nThey actually have a challenge where you and a buddy has 28 minutes to eat a 28 inch pizza. Good luck to whoever wants to try lol"
"2","Was just here this past weekend, as I took my cousin to Vegas for his 21st! Heard good things about the Palms, so decided to book my first stay here, as it seems to be one of the few hotels in Vegas I have not stayed at. For starters, the service sucked. We flew in on Friday night, pulled up in a limo (hey, I was trying to impress my cousin), and could not get a bell person to help us for several, several minutes. When I let the front desk know about it, her response was that there was only one man working for all of the people checking in. ARE YOU KIDDING?? THIS IS FRIDAY NIGHT IN VEGAS? This lady at the front desk didn't really seem to care, so I asked to see a manager. She let me know who the manager was and pointed her out, Stella was her name. Stella walked by several times and absolutely ignored me, to which the response I received was, \""oh, well Stella is off the clock, and our other manager is busy\"". Furious was an understatement at this point. Finally I reached Theta(? I think  was her name?) and she actually gave a shit. She heard me out a lot. In fact, she is the only reason this place is getting more than 1 star. She upgraded my room to a suite and apologized, nice gesture, Still, every time I called room service, front desk, house-keeping, or concierge, the line was busy my ENTIRE stay. In our hotel room we had (I think) 9 TVs, which is cool, except NONE of them worked properly. This place has gone in the shitter. Vegas has so many options for great hotels, I would not stay here again."
"5","I just enjoy eating at the Keg"
"1","I agree with Jenn C's review that it is not worth the trip out to Outremont just to visit this shop, as there are plenty of other excellent cheese shops in Montreal. I got a box of plain curds and one with pesto. I found them to be not particularly special, as they are essentially the same as the kind you can get at the supermarket (and then you would be able to control the amount of pesto you add, as I found the amount of pesto to be too heavyhanded in the pesto curds and got a sick feeling from them after just a few bites). I tried the grilled cheese sandwiches with cheddar fort: one with the fried egg, and the other with pesto. Both were quite unremarkable -- I can make better ones at home. The egg one in particular was completely bland. Worst of all, the female owner was rude and unfriendly. I will not be returning to this shop."
"4","Unfortunately, along with good Mexican food, there aren't many good Chinese restaurants in Tempe.  Given this, Mr. Hunan is a great place to get a cheap fix for your Chinese food cravings.  But here's the thing, the prices are cheap, and one reason is that it is a \""no frills\"" type of place.  Do not expect ambience, don't expect fancy plates and cutlery...don't even expect real plates and cutlery...in fact, during the summer they try to keep the costs down by not running the AC too strong...so the best thing to do is order take out or delivery.  But, despite all that, the food will be good, fresh, and won't leave a big dent in your wallet.  You will definitely get your money's worth!  In comparison, the prices are comparable to something like Panda Express, but the food is much better."
"3","My husband and I were at the Paradise Valley Mall yesterday, and instead of eating at the food court; we chose Wendy's. This Wendy's is gorgeous aesthetically, all the way down to the couch and fake fireplace! It really gives you that warm and cozy feeling!\n\nThe food offerings are great too! Not only does it offer all your Wendy's favorites, but they also have fresh baked goods. This includes cookies brownies, pieces of pie, and rolls. Want to spice up the taste of your soft drink? This is the place to do it! They offer coke products, but you can choose a variety of flavors to add, like cherry, peach, orange, raspberry or vanilla. I chose to have my usual ice tea with Splenda while my husband picked Raspberry Coke. It was enjoyed immensely!\n\nBoth of us ordered our favorite burgers, the baconator. He likes to add  tomato and extra cheese. I prefer mine with mustard, ketchup and pickle only. What happens at this point determined the three star rating. His burger did not have extra cheese which of course costs extra. \n\nWe take the receipt up to the counter and are immediately told that it does have extra cheese. By looking at my burger, we can tell this is not true. My husband goes up to the counter again, and this time he is handed a cold  piece of cheese on a disposable tray. He decides to help me eat before returning a third time!\n\nThis time the manager asks what the problem is. We explain that he added tomato and extra cheese. She says, \""did they not add tomato?\"" If you looked at the sandwich with tomato and the slice of unmelted cheese, the tomato was obviously not the issue. Finally, she put two and two together and remade his sandwich. She also reminded the employees that they cook the burgers to order and gave me a free chocolate frosty for the inconvenience!\n\nThe bottom line is this Wendy's is classy, but needs to remember the customer is always right!"
"4","This was our first time here but on the recommendation of friends. We had an excellent dinner. The scallops with shrimp were beautifully prepared and presented. The special cote de boeuf was cooked medium rare and was tender and succulent. My wife had the Buratina and the Papardelle which were also excellent. The wine list was not extensive but there was plenty to choose from to complement the meal. Wrapped it all up with a 375ml bottle of tawny port from Warres and a selection of fine Quebec cheeses. Couldn't ask for more. The decor is minimalist with the menu prominently displayed on a large blackboard which stimulated discussion around the table. There was also the option of a 7 course degustation menu which looked very interesting. There is a patio but, not surprising for a central restaurant, it is close to the road. The service was excellent. Very friendly, attentive and timely without being annoying. Prices were not cheap but I found it very good value for money. Overall it was a great experience and I would recommend St-Urbain to anyone who enjoys good food."
"4","I am always on the hunt for a good reasonable burger(miss the Midwest bar burgers) so we stopped in for a burger here. It was a Friday nite and they had a guy out there doing a few music melodies which made it quaint. The owner taking our order was awesome(Sherl)...and very helpful :) Inside was charming with all the photos on the one wall and interesting \""hippie\"" memorabilia on the other. Believe it or not, the outside had a \""small town feel\"" with the tiki benches and live music. Great place to relax and enjoy a burger!\n\nBurger was tasty and the onion rings were devine !....\nI definately am going to go back and try the fish tacos!!"
"3","SCANDALOUS FEMALE BARTENDER!!! This club is very nice! Bartender (female) near pool side, scandalous 'Breezy'! My boyfriend ordered three drinks but was charged for the guys' drinks next to us also. She said 'you were talking to him', so what! It doesnt mean the other guy was with us. $98! How does a bartender mess up like that? She wouldn't reverse charges when it was her mistake. We ended up being escorted out because she felt stupid she couldn't get an order right! $98 dollar is nothing, it's the customer service. Anyhow, we were on our way out anyway, my feet were killing me and already had my fun. Never going back though!....thieves."
"3","I'm not the hugest fan of Indian food but if I had to eat it this is where I would go. They also have a few other dishes besides Indian which is nice. The food tends to be spicey and pretty authentic!  A lot of what they offer is geared toward the vegetarian crowd."
"4","This is one of my favorite movie theaters in the Charlotte area, despite my lack of enthusiasm for shopping malls.  I normally attend movies in the late afternoons or evenings during the week and I don't purchase snacks or drinks; however, I'm super appreciative of this theater being clean and easy to locate within the mall (down at the end, across from Forever 21).  The movie schedules are great and I have even seen a few movies here that most other theaters do not show.  (For example, Dallas Buyers Club.)  There are electronic ticket kiosks if you don't want to wait in line for a ticket and I've always been a fan of the lighting near the entrance of the theater.  It doesn't really feel like you're in the middle of an outlet mall.  (Thank goodness.)  I'd give this theater five stars if the seats reclined.  :-)"
"5","What a great operation.  Rita and Terra in the office were great and spent time answering all my questions. \n\nWhile no one wants to leave their kiddos with strangers I felt so comforted by the fact that N&H runs such thorough checks on all the care providers and provides you a resume of your sitter beforehand.  Carol Cencer was incredible and I reccomend folks request her, she was genuine, kind, fun, experienced and my girls loved their time with her.  The ladies are also CPR and first aid trained/certified in the off-chance something occurs."
"2","There was something just a little off about this restaurant.  Maybe the fact that it was virtually deserted influenced my perception, but the interior was just too dark and gloomy, this despite the fact that our table had a picture window view of the Las Vegas strip in its full neon glory.\n\nThe hostess seated us at a table that was broken--the bench seat backs were gone and were \""being repaired.\""  There were at least two other similar tables on either side of us, so I dont know why she seated us there.\n\nAt first our server had a bit of an attitude, but she became very pleasant later on, so I forgive that.\n\nAnyway, the sushi was okay, not spectacular.  I did enjoy the monk fish liver.  But the California roll was mealy.  Also, eel is suppose to be served warm, mine was cold and tasted refrigerated.  The tempura was kinda greasy, which is just unacceptable.  The Saki selections and mixed drinks were very good.  \n\nOverall, a ho-hum experience.  Maybe I'm spoiled by the sushi restaurants in San Francisco, but this place just isnt up to snuff."
"3","Organization people, that's all I got to say, organization.  This place is in dire need of it.  Or maybe a map of some sort, but not like a treasure map.  I walked in to try and find a picture frame to use for a project and it took me forever to figure out that they were buried behind the knickknack area.\n\nAlso, the staff might want to take a people skills course.  Not a good experience to have them weaving in and out of customers much like a stunt car driver to avoid a question.  I really loved overhearing their conversations...\n\nOne other thing, make sure you work out a bit, that ramp connecting the levels is not fun to conquer when you're not expecting it."
"4","Nice staff. Informative during my delayed flight. Ordered the bratwurst. Good for airport food. Decent!"
"3","Dr Norton is good but too busy... Making an OBGYN apt for just the fact its your annual is hard and going and sitting in a paper vest with a paper blanket draped over you for over an HOUR waiting for your check up is just wrong... I have no down there issues.. I should be IN and OUT!!\n\nBack again to get an IUD placed... My last visit was super fast for consult ... So I'm updating my review!"
"1","Upon walking into the office I was a bit perplexed. I thought I was entering a free clinic. I'm still not sure. My appointment was for 1pm. I wasn't seen until 1:50pm. Had I been that late they would have cancelled my appointment. Nonetheless I saw Bryan Monson, at least I think it was Bryan Monson, perhaps it was (Silver Surfer: Can enter Hyperspace. tied Nova He can enter Hyperspace as well. tied Green Lantern)the whole appointment lasted 1 minute 35 seconds. He referred me to  Dr. Garcia in the office for surgery. Explained it for about 15 seconds to my daughter. I guess I'm too old to understand and was out like a shot. Yeah, errr won't be going back. No thanks for the Botox."
"3","Shawarma, pita and garlic sauce can not go wrong with some vegeatables.  Their hummus is alright, and service depends on who you get, some the friendliest in the world others seem to hate their job.  Stick with the Shawarma and it is a no fail."
"3","Loud and chaotic. Very attentive manager. But seemed to be understaffed. Everything was done at a very fast pace. Not a very relaxing atmosphere. The gnoochi were fine and the pizzas were big enough for two people but not all that tasteful. If you were looking for a sit down Italian meal and didnt want to get dressed up and get reservations, this place will do fine."
"1","\""Raunchy\"" is the most accurate description. Absinthe means \""strong and bitter.\""\n\nAfter seeing this, we were shocked by the ratings of 4 & 5. The four of us agreed this was the raunchiest of shows and the humor was mean-spirited to the point that it was not enjoyable. My husband and I have seen many shows; the two people we attended with have seen most of the shows (as they live in LV). \n\nThe \""humor' was a lot about body parts and body fluids. We could not understand why the ratings were so high. We then realized that for the 20's, young, juvenile humor, drinking crowd this was great. (Look at the photos that accompany the ratings . . most very young.) The acrobatics were good, not great. The seats were uncomfortable, wood, folding-type chairs. \n\nPay attention to the reviews, the term 'adult humor' words is not used because it is too mild of a term. Terms 'perverted' and 'dirty humor' were used for good reason. If you enjoy okay acrobatics, the lowest form of reality television, raunchiness, and humor based on ethnicity, sexual orientation, degrading others, and race, this is the show for you. If you expect great talent and an adult humor, burlesque-like show, pass on Absinthe.\n\nI should have looked up the meaning of the word before attending, \""Absinthe:  a green alcoholic drink that has a very strong and bitter flavor; green liqueur which is flavored with wormwood, anise, and other aromatic herbs and commercial production of which is banned in many countries for health concerns.\""  \n\nThe show is \""strong and bitter\"". Even if we did enjoy the humor, the tickets would have been over-priced based on the talent levels."
"4","Still enjoying shopping here at IRCA!  This big warehouse is chock-full of interesting, high quality used hotel furnishings including smaller items such as lamps, paintings, pots and pans, dishes...  you name it.  Their prices are low & of course I recommend that you double your adventure by combining your visit here with lunch at  the ever-present Lim's Chinese Buffet just down the street, either the best or worst restaurant in the Valley, depending upon who's rating it!     :-))"
"3","It's hard to get pasta wrong. Its also hard to stick out. Babbo does neither. A distinctly average yet affordable dining option located north of the 101 loop. They have lunch specials and decent pizza and wine."
"5","Quite simply, one of the most amazing, over the top dining experiences. We've dined at so many steak houses - as I have a meat loving hubby and 2 teen boys. So we've had our share of Flemings, Ruth's Chris, etc. but this was one of our first trips to the Scottsdale area. I can't believe this is a chain, as everything about it felt so personal.\n\nStand outs:\n\n- Their signature Cosmo: made with orange vodka, shaken at the table and poured into your glass with dry ice. This drink bubbles! Ooohhh I heart this.\n\n- lobster bisque: shell based stock, giant bowl with tons of chopped lobster. If you want the heavy cream based, this isn't it. It is a delish real deal bowl of heaven.\n\n- shellfish tower: giant shrimp & king crab legs. Believe it or not, I'd say it was very good. But I'd rather have the other unique items.\n\n- sides: Mac and cheese, French fries (enough to serve 10 people) and garlic mash. Kids and hubby declared the Mac and cheese the best ever.\n\n- peppercorn crusted ahi - very very tasty (spicy)\n\n- bone in aged filets: this is the stand out bad boy on the menu. Any sauce you want, but awesome enough to do without. 400degree plates. These are the most flavorful filets I've ever had.\n\n- butter cake. Just bring an insulin shot, and jump off the edge to one of gods creations. Can't even describe it. 1 cake is enough for everyone. It's like a giant, sugared pound cake ring with some fresh fruit. I will NEVER come to AZ without eating one of these.\n\nBasically, I think the chef thought \""what is the most sinful dessert\"". Then found an angel, ripped off their halo, rolled it in sugar and torched it to make it even better. That's all I can assume. Sinful, delish, and one of the best things I ever ate.\n\nAlso - 5 star service, live music.... If I run away from home, I will live here."
"2","Avoid the parking garage elevators if possible. Doors take FOREVER to open, even when pushing 'door open' button. \n\nOther than that, I have never actually stayed here so my review is not for the hotel part. \n\nI LOVE Hash House A Go Go and they are located here, have been since it was originally called Imperial Palace.\n\nThe casino is SUPER old and dingy. When I saw that the name and exterior had changed, I was in hopes that they would upgrade the interior, but it doesn't look like they got to it yet. When we were there, some of the guest elevators were being updated, or at least they had a sign saying they were.\n\nThe casino part seems really small, and it has that old stinky smell mixed w/ cigarettes, not very appealing. If you decide to go to Hash House, but aren't able to take the escalator up, they have an elevator but it is the TINIEST elevator ever!!! Maybe room for 2-3 people and that is it. When you are walking on the casino floor it is easy to pass it because it just looks like it would be a support beam, its that small!!!\n\n#flagproof"
"4","Stylish place with a nice patio (when open). Food is decent enough, but really the place to come if you like Tequila. Four hundred types of Tequila on stock."
"3","So this hotel is about 30 minutes by car from where you want to be in Edinburgh. I came with a tour group, so it might not be your typical experience. \n\nThe staff is amazingly kind and extremely helpful, but wifi cost something like \u00a37 per hour or something like \u00a316 for 24 hours! There is free wifi in common areas like the lounge, bar, caf\u00e9s with a very strong signal, but it's not great when you are having an emergency at home and end up bawling in the lounge area like I did. Another guest brought me tissues and a very nice employee brought me water... \n\nThere is a great gym, pool and even workout classes are offered! I'm not sure about the golf, but it looked pretty. The beds were very comfy, but while doing yoga in the room, I encountered hair belonging to someone else which made me think it wasn't vacuumed well.  \n\nBest breakfast so far this trip with omelette bar and amazing number of hot choices."
"3","Not bad, not great, but not bad. I stopped by here for a spot of Sunday brunch with a good friend. I walked past many tasty looking cafes to get here, so had high hopes that it would be top notch.\n\nInside, it's all dark wood, rickety furniture and it has charm. It was busy, so it must be popular. The menu wasn't hugely extensive and felt like it hadn't been updated in a good 5 years or so. This isn't necesarily a bad thing. But when I saw the 'full breakfasts' being brought to other tables they reminded me more of traditional Scottish greasy-spoon fare than the best of the best brunch standards. So, I went for the Eggs Benedict.\n\nBrunch, espeically after a hard night partying with some of the best Yelpers in town the night before, is sacred to me. It should soothe your hungry tummy, calm your slightly sore head, and warm the cockles of your soul. The eggs benedict were nice enough but quite bland. And they weren't served with bacon, they were served with wafer-thin slices of smoked ham. A bit of a disappointment.\n\nAlso, it didn't help that we were sitting near-ish the front door, and once or twice a waitress stood holding it open when talking to customers, lettings all the freezing cold air in, and cooling down my eggs a lot. The result was one tasty egg, and one very cold egg. Humpf.\n\nThe cakes in the cake stand looked very nice. And I've heard there is a great jazz night here, which I must investigate.\n\nBut compared to other places I've eaten brunch in, this was very average. Although I must give a shout out to the waitresses who were all very friendly and efficient, and really had their eye on every table ensuring we weren't kept waiting. If it hadn't been for the cold door = cold egg scenario, maybe I would have been happier."
"5","I'll admit, it has been many years since I have had an actual meal here. The only reason I come is for the to die for cheesecake. It used to be that I would typically get the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake, which by the way, is sinful. Well, I guess they all are. It has an Oreo crust, chocolate chips throughout and on the top, and a generous dollop of whipped cream on the side. Then they introduced the Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake and I'm like, seriously, Cheesecake Factory? It has a moist, red velvet cake surrounded by layers of cheesecake. It also has a cream cheese frosting with what tastes like white chocolate shavings in the frosting. I came here yesterday with the excuse of validating my parking token (as my husband puts it, yeah right!). I got the Cookie Dough slice and then I noticed the Red Velvet which I thought was just a limited time. So what was an indecisive girl to do but get both slices. $16 later (yikes!) but I am the happiest girl in the world."
"3","Loved the name of this place, so i needed to investigate another happy hour. This HH goes til 7 with 1/2 price beer and a food specials menu consisting mostly of bar stuff. The $2 pretzel was killer; hot and buttery and had a decent queso dip on side. Not the same luck on the $4 street tacos. The chicken is thigh meat and the steak had no resemblence to steak or carne asada and the tacos were loaded with too much sauce and cheap cabbage. Pretty average beer selection and not all seats at the bar can view the tv screens. Nice patio though and there was one pizza with potatoes that looked unique that i need to try on next visit.  Not packed at all for monday night football."
"4","My bf and I decided to take my cousin here for dinner per my cousin's request.  I wasn't sure what to expect but was very impressed by the service and food.  \n\nWe were served with this refreshing tea that was in an original looking jug.  The cups were made of some kind of silver metal and I think it was a bowl too.  Different.  Our server was very attentive and constantly came to our table to make sure we were okay and if we were ready to choose our dinner.\n\nWe finally chose and this was what we ended up with.\n1.)  Albap 8:  Kimchi, vegetables and fish roe on top of rice in a stone pot.  This was really good.  The fish roe gave it a good flavor.\n\n2.)  Ribs:  This was a little tough to eat.  I'm used to my ribs falling apart very easily.\n\n3.)  Chicken in hot sauce:  Too hot for my liking.  They said it wasn't too hot, but my pallet says otherwise.\n\n4.)  Side dishes with gaikon, asian broccolli, kimchi, beef, and I can't think of the names of the others.  But it was definitely a lot of side dishes on top of what we had ordered.\n\nOverall experience was top notch!"
"4","Just went here the other night. Solid food. Awesome Belgian beer."
"5","Revamped menu, outstanding service and great atmosphere - not much has changed.  Our server Adrienne was outstanding and attentive and gracious.  The busboys and other guys were great as well.  We had the filet, the ribeye, the Dover sole special, garlic green breans with chili flakes, sauteed mushrooms, caesar salad and nice bottle of Cab.  Definitely will keep coming back."
"1","Terrible food ever ! I myself an Asian and love to have indian food all the time, I checked out online and saffron indian restaurant came out, saw some reviews and decided to get some food. \nWell let me describe 1st\nI ordered one chicken biryani, one garlic naan and  one hot and sour chicken curry with plain rice. I normally don't notice the food when im super hungry, but today I didn't get any chance to say the food was good. 1st the garlic naan was so hard and thick.probably the cook was new or food was frozen, same was the biryani(fried rice with some pices chicken),\nAnd the HoT and sour chicken curry was SWEET. I never had that sweet curry before. Nothing was fresh at all.  wondering why  people are writing something good about it, very expensive comparing their food quality.Totally worthless !!!!!"
"2","Bah. You know when you keep giving somewhere just another chance because it used to be good? Well, I think last night was the night I gave up. \n\nI used to love Khushi's in Victoria Street. It was a dramatic building, and I had some great food there. \n\nThen it burnt down, and they moved to a fairly boring cellar under the Pear Tree and - I don't know, seemed to lose their way. Sauces were boring and tasted 'out of a jar', and worse, the staff would positively force feed you to get you out fast. But I reasoned to myself that I had gone during the festival and at Christmas, and nowhere is at its best when it's so busy. \n\nFinally, Khushi has its new home, in Antigua Place at the top of Leith Walk. It's taken over a big space that used to be Massimo's (I miss Massimo's), and from the outside it looks bright and cheerful and the place-to-be. \n\nSo last night I called and asked for a reservation for four. They had a table, though we'd have to be out in 90 minutes. That seemed fair, we just wanted a quick meal. \n\nFrom the second we arrived, though, it all went wrong. We were shown into a bare 'overspill' room off to the side, harassed to order fast, and then the unsmiling waiter announced that he'd 'bring your starters and mains at the same time, because you have to be out soon'. Charming...\n\nAnd so he did, slapped everything down and off he went, to practise his lack of social skills on someone else. \n\nThe food was okay, I suppose - fish pakora were tasty, the veg pakora a bit dry for my liking. My tandoori monkfish - I've had it before there and loved it, but last night it was a bit overcooked. And... maybe not actually monkfish? The texture just wasn't quite right so I was suspicious. \n\nAnyway, we ate, we got full. Mostly it was basic British Indian food in over-creamy sauces. And we were finished long before the time they were due to throw us out.\n\nThere are too many good restaurants in Edinburgh to have to put up with actively rude service. I've had enough, and won't be back."
"1","I was excited about visiting a new Indian restaurant in Downtown Pittsburgh that is in close proximity to my office, but this lunch buffet visit of Monday, 22 September 2014 was a great disappointment.  I received a pleasant greeting and a 'thank you' from the owner.  The busser did not interact with me. No one performed a quality check or did anything to be assured of my satisfaction. Used plates were taken away promptly and I received a water refill without having to ask.  I agree with the writer who said that the place was too hot; this was the case even on a cool day. I had perspiration running down my neck while dining. Beware the dish which contains microscopic particles that appear to resemble broccoli and cauliflower as it is very spicy.  The only vegetable that could be readily identified in it is a few carrot slices.  I was hoping to find the staple Indian dish, aloo gobi, but it was not offered.  There was a dish which featured only potato slices and the cauliflower offered in the vegetable dish was not enough to satisfy any diner.  I arrived at 12:45, which should be the height of lunch hour.  There were only two diners there at that time, although a few other parties arrived during the short time I was there.  The buffet items had obviously been sitting out for a long time.  The white rice, which I was pleased to find was unadulterated by any seeds or seasoning, was in small quantities of clumps.  Many of the dishes needed to be replenished, but only the fried vegetable dish was during the time that I was there.  The signs denoting the names of the dishes are do not enable the American customer to determine their ingredients.  The tandoori chicken was quite tasty; I can only imagine how good it would have been if it had at least been served warm.  India Palace and Indian Spices on Sixth Street are far better choices for the Indian food lover, and Indian Spices is 58 cents less for the lunch buffet!"
"4","First time and food was good. Ribs fell off te bone and loved the baked beans."
"1","I have been at this Thai Basil more than a couple of times, but today will be the last time. I was seated on the far right table close to the kitchen by the wall. I was enjoying the peanut curry with Thai tea. As I was finishing up my meal, I had a weird feeling and looked at the wall to my right to see a disgusting roach I quickly moved over and looked up to the wall behind me to find 2 other small roaches.... I almost puked! PLEASE if you care for your health DO NOT HEAT HERE."
"3","Had to try Over Easy out this weekend after reading about it this week on Chow Bella. I wanted to love this place but walked away with only a like. I will give it one more try as my table mates were happy with their selections, me not so much.   \n\nMediterranean omelet-great\nBrioche French toast - so good\nEggs with saut\u00e9ed wild mushrooms and herbs-fail. Someone in the kitchen needs to learn how to saut\u00e9 mushrooms.  Mine were steamed,not saut\u00e9ed....ruined the taste of the mushrooms. Such a disappointment.\n\nOne last thing......yes the OJ was very good, but at $6.00 a glass,ummm maybe not that good"
"1","So disappointed in the level of customer service. I came here before with my wife, the customer service was great ...years ago.\nBUT NOW.....\nWhile the manager was over and stopped by, he asked if I had a special request. He said He can make it happen in 4 minutes. 30 mins later nothing, but the took my plate without asking. So it is not all you can eat. I am just really picky, no fat- no red. I wasn't done eating. Texas De Brazil is now far better based solely on customer service."
"4","My co-workers always talk about this place so I figured to give it a try with a group of friends. I ordered the 1/2 meat lovers skillet with blueberry protein pancakes....it was BOMB! The sweetness of cinnamon and blueberries just went so together with the syrup. The skillet itself was phenomenal. My girlfriend loved her eggs Benedict. I think I just found my Sunday breakfast joint!"
"5","Most delicious toffee ever tasted. The variety of flavors to choose from  Is made to perfection which  certainly satisfies the sweet tooth. I first discovered the toffee at the Bruce Trent Farmers Market.  I also like the fact I  buy online to share with family and friends for those special occasions.  :)"
"2","we dined here on our first wedding anniversary. We had high expectations from this AAA 4 diamond and michelin rated restaurant. we chose this one in particular since the menu appealed the most to us.\n\nWhen we walked in at peak dining hour, we were surprised to find the restaurant so empty (not that we mind). En route to the restaurant we did find a lot of activity at other bellagio restaurants which makes me wonder why this place did not attract any crowds. The location is also not as attractive as the other bellagio restaurants facing the musical fountains.\n\nThe cocktail we ordered on our server's recommendation was the most disappointing $14 cocktail I've ever had. It just tasted like cucumber water.\n\nWe always wanted to try the hamachi crudo and decided to give it a shot. It comes with green apple, winter black truffle, tempura crunch. Everything combined it was very tasty with the tempura providing the crunchy texture.\n\nOur server recommended \""three seas\"" tasting of japanese fish, bamboo rice, ginger vinaigrette so went for it. There was scallop, hamachi and snapper. They all tasted the same since the ginger vinaigrette was too overpowering. Paying $45 for that dish was a complete waste of money.\n\nWe had the TRUFFLE-STUFFED CHICKEN with SAVOY CABBAGE, SUNCHOKE-PEAR PUR\u00c9E, FOI GRAS RICE. There were hardly any truffles to be found in the chicken. moreover, the chicken itself was bland and unseasoned. The savoy cabbage had some flavor and foi gras rice was probably the star of the dish. \n\nFor a michelin rated restaurant, the food fell short of expectations. I've dined at a lot of fine dining restaurants and have had better bang for the buck than here."
"4","This rating is based on food more than service, which is fine, I'd rather have great food & so-so service\n\nIn town for yet another trade show, we ran from the strip & found this place (thanks yelpers!!)\nSmallish, cramped space, and packed! So we knew it must be good.\nThey fit us in with no res (on a Thursday), and the service was decent, not rude, but rushed & they got one thing wrong, but not major.\nThe menu is augmented with \""specials\"" on paper all over the walls. Helps if you speak Japanese I think (another good sign).\nSo we just kept ordering more after looking around, and everything was GOOD. \nThis is not your typical \""American\"" sushi joint with Calif roll/ spicy tuna roll. This is real Japanese food, some twists like Jalapeno friend rice, which we heard was good from the guy next to us.\nSo if you want GOOD, fresh, real food, this is the place.\nMaybe make a res!\nAnd there's a bakery next door that has yummy dessert.\nGo across the street for a fab foot massage to end the evening."
"2","This airport is indeed one of my favorites and I normally stop in at the news shops, but this one was a huge let down.\n\nThe staff were not friendly at all and it got worse when I didn't make a donation to whatever they were collecting for at the moment.\n\nThe selection was ok, but there were no decent hats, which is what I typically pick up!\n\nThankfully there are plenty of other places to look around in while you are waiting on your plane!"
"3","The last few times we have been here, we've sat upstairs at the bar.  Franco has always been our server so the last time we were there I asked him how long he had been working there - 35 years was the response.  Kudos Franco.\n\nWe have tried many items on the menu.  The food is mediocre, but satisfying and flavorful.  The lavosh is incredible.  Stay away from the cajun chicken quesadilla (very messy and only cheez and chix) and the buffalo wings scared me a bit (not a fan of pulling apart pieces of chicken).  I would recommend the veggie lavosh or the cajun lavosh.  We have had the fruit plate (LOTS of fruit - great for a hot summer day), and various sandwiches.  \n\nThe prices aren't too bad - the drinks are a little on the pricey side.  The other employees are generally friendly and helpful.  It's a great place for late night eats."
"5","Love this place...I like that it is strangley situated in a business center, and I drove around like a fool before finding it. I first spotted the outside patio area, it was very Miami, white curtains flowing, comfy patio furniture, there was a wedding party there and it looked so fashionable, like out of a magazine. The inside decor was a mixture of contemporary/modern Pottery Barn-esque with a splash of beach feel, I liked the little nooks built into the wall, it was like just a little bit of Morocco thrown in as well. Ok onto the food, the first time I went there I did a cheese board and some wine, they have a great cheese selection and I really enjoyed my order. Second time I had split 2 entrees with my friend so we could try both, we ordered the halibut with cous cous, spinach, toasted orzo, lemon gremolata and sweet tomatoes, I politely asked if they could hold the butter, and the server was very nice, didn't give me a hard time, this dish was wonderful, halibut was cooked to perfection, definitely recommend, the show stopper though was the bouillabaisse with mussels, clams, shrimp, snapper, calamari, scallops and saffron broth. This was so delicious, comparable to cioppino, but the saffron broth gave it a different twist. The calamari was outstanding. Service was outstanding, our server was very attentive, my water glass was never empty, they continually came around to give you more bread, oh the bread....awesome bread basket....carb addicts dream. The is a place I wouldn't hesitate to take out of towners or recommend to locals."
"4","Great food , the salmon was to die for.\nThe waiter was informative and had a stupid attitude when we had questions ,good price  4 star since it was my first time here and I hate rude and very unfriendly waiter"
"4","A nice old school Sushi restaurant. Very relaxed feeling, not the uppity type place where you feel not worthy of their time. Very good sushi and very good prices. The chefs were very entertaining and fast. Saki bombs are always best when shared w/the chefs! Soju shots can really sneak up on you!"
"5","Urban Mutts has changed their name to So Fetch! I took my Saint Bernard and my cocker spaniel here. They did an UNBELIEVEABLE JOB! My Saint Bernard came in with an awful thick coat and she has a summer cut with a lion's tail that's PURPLE! She looks GORGEOUS. So Fetch did above and beyond to what I was expecting. Bridget, my St. Bernard, now has pigtails with beautiful Hawaiian flowers. She has never looked so girly. When I had my cocker spaniel done named Leo, I mentioned that I wanted the long hair shaved off and again, So Fetch did above and beyond and made him look handsome with his new clean cut appearance while keeping his signature ears and legs. To top everything off, Leo and Bridget now have glitter!"
"5","This place is awesome! \n\nI'm always looking for a good burger and I don't have to look any further! I've passed this place several times and always wondered how good their food is. \n\nSo what did I do? I Yelped it and found out it had some pretty great reviews. \n\nI went with my sister on Saturday. We pulled in to the parking lot and already it was getting pretty busy for just opening (11am). We walked in and it was pretty small, but hey, these kinds of places usually are. \n\nThe menu is pretty limited when it comes to their burger. They have \""The Standard\"". But when you make something right, why deviate from it? I got mine with jalapenos and we ordered some fries. \n\nIt was busy, so the wait was a little longer than we expected but it was definitely worth it. \n\nThe burger and fries are so fresh, hot and good! If I could just make one minor suggestion, it would be to toast the bun on the grill a little bit. I\n\nNeedless to say, I felt like a huge fatty after I left. I'd definitely come back again. I saw a woman eating some tacos. Maybe I'll try those next!"
"5","Amazing Texas-style BBQ. Tried a little everything with my wife. Sausage, pulled pork, ribs, brisket, beans, jalape\u00f1o cheddar grits and potato salad with pecan pie to end it . Have to admit the pulled pork was a little lacking on flavor but was very moist and tender. The sausage was amazing and flavorful. The briskest's charred rub left me speechless. And the ribs seasoning was great. Would absolutely recommend it to anyone in search of good BBQ in Arizona."
"4","This is a fast casual establishment. Quick walk-up service and fast delivery to table, both courteous. I ordered the chicken tenders rice bowl with medium Buffalo sauce and a OMG Copper beer. After sitting down I noticed is been charged $3.50 instead of $3.00 (import price instead of domestic price). Since Copper is brewed here in Charlotte, I asked the manager (Andrew) for a refund of the difference, and he gave me the 50\u00a2 without debate. But, he explained that the cash register has only two settings (import and domestic) and that Copper is considered an \""import\"" because it's a craft beer. He even called an owner to explain this to me, but I declined to get in the middle. I simply suggested that the owners consider rewording their menu to make the prices clear instead of basing their reasoning on a dichotomous cash register setting. \n\nOverall, for this type of place, I have to give at least 3 stars -- food and service were quite good. I added a solid fourth star because Andrew remained not just courteous during our interaction, but was curious enough to research the issue and displayed integrity in reporting back the owner's answer. I hope to be back, and won't dispute the Copper price next time now that I understand the backstory."
"4","The happy hour deal was great!! I got 3 vegan rolls for under $8 and miso and edamame were free. \n\nI love sushi but have never gone on my own to a sushi restaurant, the staff was not very helpful despite my obvious confusion about how to go about seating myself and ordering. \n\nIf you are unfamiliar with sushi restaurants, perhaps start somewhere else or bring a friend, but the quality of the rolls was great and the price was even better."
"4","I've stayed at nearly every hotel in Madison in this price range. There's not a lot of variation in the quality of the hotel or the rooms themselves. The devil, as they say, is in the details.\n\nPros:\n\n*free Wi-Fi\n\n*free parking\n\n*comfortable bed\n\n*warm chocolate chip cookies at check-in\n\n*convenient location\n\n*indoor pool and whirlpool\n\n*on-site restaurant \n\n*friendly staff\n\n*free local shuttle\n\nCons:\n\n*weird shower. Clearly they're going for a \""European\"" feel as there was only half a glass door on the stall so I experienced an unpleasant draft on my backside during the shower\n\n*it's a little dated. This used to be a Howard Johnson, and it still has a bit of a \""low budget\"" feel\n\n*slow elevators, and too few\n___________________________________________\n\nAs with any hotel in any city, price will vary during season. We happened to be in Madison during move-in weekend for incoming freshman at UW, so the price was likely higher than normal, but still was not terribly expensive.\n\nAlthough the location was great, it was also across the street from a house that some undergrads were moving into and hosting a kegger, so it was a bit loud at times, but thankfully it ended early. Come to think of it, the whole neighborhood is full of undergrad housing, so be forewarned.\n\nThis isn't my favorite hotel in Madison, but I would definitely stay here again."
"4","Finally a coffee shop by work!  The muffins are simply delicious.  I had pumpkins, lemon poppy seed and blueberry to date.  \n\nEarlier today I tried the ice tea.  It was flavored and infused with a berry shot - simply delicious.  \n\nA good place to sit back read a paper and kick back."
"5","If they had 4.5 stars, thats where mine would lie.  I went  here with 4 buddies of mine during my last trip to vegas.  My friend was a huge top chef fan so he insisted we check this spot out.  Our entire table ordered the Kobe Tasting Menu and I was not disappointed.  All the steaks were amazing, my two favorite was the Filet Mignon and Skirt Steak.  The appetizers that we were served was nothing impressive.  Roasted red peppers, Prosciutto ( I can get buy that at a deli), mixed greens, and an artichoke dish defintely did not wow me at all.  The sides were decent.  The desserts were amazing tho.  Make sure you get some Monkey Bread that was one of the best deserts i've ever had.  \n\nOverall, i go to a steakhouse for steak and they had some of the best tasting beef i've ever had.  Would definitely reccomend it."
"3","Nice, convenient location in uptown. I went in just to see what the deals were and what was in the pre-made entrees section of the store. There was a pretty good selection but nothing that really grabbed my attention so I walked out and went to a more appetite appeasing restaurant."
"3","This is one of the smallest Zehrs in the region but it has everything most customers wouldl want.  Great selection in the natural foods section.  Only missing department is Joe Fresh but there is no room for them.  If you're a fan of JF check out the Superstore on Highland or Stanley Park Mall Zehrs."
"3","3.5 stars. \n\nWent with a group of friends this weekend for the open bar mostly. Guys got in for 20, which isn't that bad. Bouncers were a little rude for cover, not cool. \n\nTAO is really nice, appearance wise. Walking though the restaurant before going to the club did make me hungry. what a tease. \n\nWent early enough where there wasn't any issues of space. Our main goal here was drink, so we didn't get to explore the other dance floors, but that's okay, maybe next time. While most of the drink were aight, they made some pretty bad basic well drinks, and the wait to get a drink was long. Like come on, messing up a rum and coke? and waiting as much as I was dancing wasn't too hot either. But hey, was feeling really good after we left, so I'm not complaining too much, The music wasn't that bad too. Too bad we didn't know that dash berlin was playing that night. Well, bad that we didn't get to hear him play. good because we left before it got ridiculously packed. We were ale to dance with a great amount of space. and trust, with a group of dancers, we need our space. \n\nOverall, not a bad time at TAO. Guess I need another trip to really go exploring."
"2","Quick Summary: Savers sucks. \n\nI don't understand why people like this place. It's very overpriced. I've been in and out of this location several times and even with a family group who loves to go thrift store shopping we've maybe found $20 worth of stuff to buy in here. And 1/4 of that was two aluminum water bottles I found. \n\nCustomer service? I'm laughing at myself for even mentioning it. Hey, at least they have plenty of parking! And you can always walk over to Colleen's consignment shop a couple of doors down to make the most of your trip here. \n\nOtherwise looking for another thrift store somewhere else might be a good idea."
"4","It's 3:30am and after karaoke-ing, Lebanese food sounded like a perfect way to end the night. \n\nBoustan's is a teeny eatery situated downstairs from a nightclub, a spot where all the drunkies go to post partying. \n\nOh but boustan's isn't just good for post-drunk meal, (i.e. dennys lol), their food is absolutely delicious.\n\nThe staff looks like they've been there for too long, but hey they're doing something right with their food.\n\nTried their potatoes had this yummy creamy garlic sauce atop. Also tried their chicken shwarma pita. The pita was toasted warm, crunchy on the outside, and soft inside. Their mix of veggies they throw in there definitely adds more life to that pita. \n\nOne thing I didn't fancy was that they went overboard with their garlic mayo sauce. Wayyy too much of that in there, but you'd hate to ask for an amended version because the main guy here reminds you of the soup nazi. Like, this ain't BK, it would almost be rude to have it your way. Nonetheless, all the food was good, and cheap.\n\nBetter than many of the LA spots that serve similar food, but certainly still not the best. Solid 4 stars here."
"1","They ruined my wife's birthday dinner.  Very slow service.  My son's steak tasted like sand (freezer burn?).  The waitress said that they are getting new steaks next week.  My daughter and I had the chicken - Dry ... She had a \""creamed corn\"" which means that the corn was in a \""biscuits and gravy sauce\"".  My wife had the oriental chicken salad - it was ok."
"4","***This review based on happy hour only.\n\nI'm excited about this place.  While I was slightly disappointed in the complete lack of happy hour drink or food specials (how can you refuse to acknowledge happy hour??), by the time I left, I was still a fan.  My optimistic potential viewpoint is based on these 2 unique factors:\n\n1) amazing rooftop bar.  Seriously.  We were up there at about 8:30pm on a 102-degree day, and it was honestly comfortable!  I had been skeptical that we'd be able to make it, but between the misters and canvas \""retractable ceiling tiles,\"" it was a pleasant way to view an amazing sunset over Camelback and Squaw Peak.  This view is fantastic and I am glad that Del Frisco's is taking full advantage of it.  This rooftop is simply cool, and made me feel like I was in a real, proper city!\n2) complimentary valet.  But even better than just the complimentary valet right in front of the restaurant, the valet also has an option where you can text them 10 minutes before you're ready to go, and your car will be pulled up when you walk out.  This makes this place a very convenient place to meet up without having to deal with parking!\n\nThe cocktails and wine list were pretty standard, and we had a flatbread pizza that was really yummy.  But it was the rooftop bar and valet that will make me come back -- and next time, stay for dinner."
"3","I love hot dogs so when I noticed this spot for a quick bite in the alley next to Q outside Flamingo I went for it. Food is pricey in Vegas so a quick bite was a nice change from the LONG lines for $$$ everywhere. No wait. I'm in! Great onion rings, Chicago dog was good, bun was a bit crusty, toppings good, but the Detroit Coney looked amazing. Guy next to me got his after I ordered. \nNoticed a lot of local employees popping in to grab a bite at the counter. Always a good idea to follow the locals and I was not disappointed."
"4","Good crust and quality toppings...not bad at all."
"3","Food was very tasty and the presentation  was exceptional.  I would have preferred a larger portion. It seems in France you get generous portions, but French restaurants in the U.S. Not so much. It seemed a little pricey for the amount of food."
"4","So i realized that they have the same exact menu as sushi mon on maryland pkwy and silverado ranch. same owner. Same price. Great rolls. Everything came out fresh. But they had great specialty rolls just like sushi mon. It took a lil long for rolls and ahi poke was so-so. People reviewing it talked about green tea creme brulee. But they didnt have it on menu. So i was a little dissapointed. But generally happy wit the whole experience."
"1","This place doesn't even deserve one star but I want to post a review. This place is nasty dirty and the thing working the drive through looks like madea. never go there I'm telling you ya gotta believe me. This is my first review and I felt I had let everyone know how bad this place is. And this place stinks."
"5","huge projector!"
"1","Susan started out great and helped with my green pool problem.  Then she stopped coming and did not return my calls or texts.  I paid Susan for a month, and possibly a month and a half for which I got no service.  When I asked for my money back I did not get a reply."
"5","Excellent service, bread was hot and fresh, pizza cooked to perfection and price was very reasonable"
"1","Complete scam.  \n\nI was moving and called 3 times to have my service address changed--the person on the phone couldn't ever figure out how to schedule it, and no one ever called me back.  I had another company set up my service at the new house and called ADT to cancel.  She was very nasty and informed me that there would be a charge of $376 for canceling my contract early.  I told her the only reason I canceled is because they wouldn't return my calls to have the service moved.  \n\nI just realized that they have continued to charge my credit card for the past 3 months.  I called to cancel AGAIN, and the guy tells me it's going to be $376."
"4","This review is for one item. .. The Vanilla Swirl! Let's call it the traveling vanilla swirl.  This thing. ..*pauses for a drop breath* is everything I could have asked for and more. Its soft it's flavorful... it's puts plain croissants to shame. I purchased two and they are very filling so I was barely able to finish one. The next day I put the second swirl in the oven and continued my affair with this lovely lovely carbohydrate.  I am biased because I love all things vanilla and the only thing that was missing for me was a light caramel drizzle because I love all things caramel and vanilla even more."
"2","Loved this place for a while. I don't mind that it's closed on Sundays as I work on the weekends. The problem I find is that checkout usually takes about 20 minutes, sometimes longer. Tons of checkout stations with very little staff. 6 stations, 2 open with 30 people in line at one in the afternoon. Usually you hear the manager get on the speaker \""cashiers to the front\"". Not here. Just wait in line, wasting away the day. It wouldn't bother me as much if I didn't see 20 or more employees walking around all over the store. \n\nEven with the long lines, this was the only store that sold Dill buttons. If you aren't someone that uses buttons that often, this means nothing. Dill makes high quality buttons for blazers and suits. Metal and plastic. The Hobby Lobby brand and most other brands are plastic crap. Recently HL has stopped selling Dill and only offers the store brand so they can do 2 for 1 specials. \n\nAt least I don't have to bother with the lines anymore. Now I order online."
"1","Ordered basket of wings today for take out. Told me 20 mins. Waited for 40 mins. Really? The owner Ron was there. Told him.. And he did told the manager to look. That's it. No one appeared to be really sorry as they don't care . Really?"
"3","I usually stay at the Monte Carlo. I like the location and it's easy to find your way around.  I'm not giving up on the Monte Carlo just yet but they have some issues with maintenance and housekeeping.  The carpets are dirty and the bathroom has issues that would make Bob Vila crap his pants. That said, none of these issues were bad enough to repack my clothes and ask for another room. It's Vegas who stays in their room for a long"
"1","Worst place ever!! They will charge your ass way to much for a bottle and the music blows ass. It's a mixture of of techno drake and break dancing music!! Wth and there is nothing but guys in there. The manager guy is a dick And the Korean girl if u see her trip her! The coin machines will eat your quarters just stay home and drink there with your friends waaay cheaper. Cover charge also ?? Yes even for girls go to beauty bar across the street better vibe and no dick head jersey shore asshole charging u"
"4","Had my fiance's bday here with a party of 22 people. Service was quick and easy. Food menu was fine, we didn't care much. But happy hour menu had great deals. What we liked best about it was there were TV screens, everywhere. We didn't miss a moment of the games we wanted to watch. big plus. Also it was Friday night and the place wasn't that packed, so it was laid back and everyone was able to talk and just chilled the night away."
"2","We tried Wild Tuna's recently.   I can't say that I would go back as the pices are high, the sushi is just OK, and the amibience and service are sub par.\n\nLikes:   The Green Eggs and Ham roll had a nice bite to it and I liked it\n\nDislikes:  The sushi.  The choices are very limited, the portions are very small for the price, and the presentation is poor.  The spider roll was not as good as others in the area, too oily for my taste.\n\nBeverages:  Although it has the word spirits in it's name don't expect too much.  They carry only one \""Japanese\"" beer Asahi which is made by Miller in the US.  There is no menu for Sake so you have to just order it with no idea on what it is or what it will cost.  Even the non-alcoholic choices are poor.  If you order tea (usually pretty good in most sushi restaurants) you'll get a crappy teabag in a large stainless steel pot producing a poor excuse for a cup of tea.\n\nBottom line:  If you like Sushi, go elsewhere, you will spend less money, get better food, and have a more positive experience"
"4","I had never tried Indian food before and there's no better way to try it for the first time than to come here for their lunch buffet. Prices are very reasonable: $8.99 and the selection is pretty extensive. There were at least 4-5 different vegetarian currey options and 3 different meat options.  \n\nAll the food was very fresh with tons of flavor. You're instantly smacked in the face with all the different aromas of the Indian spices as soon as you enter the restauarant. The service was also great. My water glass never got more than half empty before someone was by to refill it. I was very impressed. \n\nI think my favorite part of the whole experience was the Naan basket. They give you a basket of what looks like toasted pita bread, but it's so much better! It comes plain and with garlic and WOW the garlic naan was SOO good. I could probably just sit there and eat that all day. \n\nOverall, this was a good first experience. A little overwhelming since I didn't know what half of the food was, but it all tasted delicious."
"5","Having been a bookmark on my Yelp account for some time now, we finally got the chance to try this place out! We headed in and were greeted right away. We didn't have a reservation, but we lucked out and got there earlier than the rush, so we were seated in a nice booth up front.  The place filled up pretty quickly after we arrived, so I would recommend calling ahead if you have a larger party (and they only seat your party once everyone has arrived, so keep that in mind, too).\n\nOur waitress was Leslie and she was wonderful from the very start.  Friendly and accommodating she allowed us a bit of time to look over the menu and made recommendations based on our preferences, which worked out nicely.  I had the Lo-Lo's meal and he had the Double D meal, we shared an order of cornbread, cause...who turns down southern style cornbread?? We opted to try out a couple of their drinks which I cannot remember the names of, but they were good! \n\nThe meals came out quickly an were exactly the way we ordered them and they smelled amazing. Chicken was cooked nicely and the breading was really well seasoned. Waffles were fluffy and perfect. The cornbread was gone within seconds of hitting the table. \n\nDespite being way too full for it, we shared a banana pudding for a dessert, which was worth every agonizingly over full bite! I highly recommend this if you from the south and like a good banana pudding with real slices of banana and wafer topping!\n\nOverall: A+\nGreat service, great southern food with hilarious names (amazing dessert for a bonus), and fun ambiance make this place a \""will absolutely return\"" venue!"
"3","Great ambience.  Sat out on back patio.  Felt the waitress was a bit snooty.  I think the concept of the food is great, but not so great in execution.  The guacamole everyone raved about \""made tabelside\"" was made over in a corner and brought over to the table already made.  I would have liked to watch them make it.  Was just about one large scoop and that was it.  Left us wanting more, but flacor wasn't really there.  Underseasoned and overpriced at $12.00.  And the chips were undercooked so crunchy onthe outside, but tought toward the middle.  The chicken skewers with mole sauce was dry and mole was just ok.  The sweet potatoe/french fries were just like any other restaurants, but loved the sauces.  Tacos (ckicken) were just ok.  \nThe much acclaimed pumpkin bread pudding was excellent, but only about a 3 inch square.  Just a teaser size.\n\nI think if you don't mind spending the money, can get by the snooty waitress, and want to try something different, go for it.  Everyone in the area said to try Los Olivos right around the corner for really good Mexican food."
"3","When my friends and I entered Coyote Ugly in Vegas, the first thing that impressed me quite a bit was the hanging bras displayed near the right side wall facing the dance floor and some hanging on top of the dance floor. Made me think, \""Wow, they're really taking it off!\"" LOL\n\nI only gave three stars coz I see it as \""okay\"" of a place. I was not blown away. Too many drunk women (and that's bad?) being loud and full of non-sense. Of course there were weird looking men with that around. I guess my mood at that time was bleckh. I was mostly people-watching and hardly drinking. I didn't want to be drunk with that particular crowd that night. \n\nAt least dancing was good."
"3","Ok I would give this place four stars, but on the outside of the store it states that there is a clearance sale and everything inside is 90 percent off and it is not.  I think that this place overcharges for piercings, if you want a piercing just go down the block to Ink Link, twenty dollars for everything all day long.  The good thing about this place is that they carry Serial Killer shirts and I love 'em.  They feature movies like Taxi Driver and Pulp Fiction.  Even though they have false advertisement outside the store, the clerks are still pretty pleasant."
"1","Horrible, horrible Honda service. I went in with questions because a strange light kept coming on in my car. When I showed up, they were plain rude. Basically told me that my tires just needed air and they refused to check them because \""too many\"" people are having the same issue. Gee, if too many people are having the same issue, don't you think you might want to take a closer look? These men never even got off the chair, let alone take a peek at my vehicle.\n\nThe second time I went to inquire about my lease turn-in, it was the same RUDENESS. The salesmen acted as if I was wasting their time. They could not answer one of my questions. I even asked to speak with a manager. He was less than impressive and stood by the doorway trying to rush me out. \n\nI will NEVER do service with this Honda dealership. They really need to get their staff  some serious training in basic customer service!"
"5","They have the BEST springrolls---not fried!  We also love their pad thai---spiced to your palate."
"4","I usually hate chains, especially Italian ones like Olive Garden and Romanos. But I was pleasantly surprised my Maggianos. We went because we got a gift card for Christmas but we are probably going back. \n\nThe bread and the dipping oil they start you out with is pretty good. I wish the dipping oil was just a little more seasoned though. My husband ordered the linguine and clams which he said was just ok. My stepson had the crab and shrimp cannelloni which he enjoyed. I really liked my eggplant Parmesan. It is the best egg parm I have had at a chain. The sauce is fresh tasting which huge chunks of garlic.\n\nOne nice surprise is that our server said that my dish qualified for a free take home dish of the same category. So I ordered the gnocchi and had a nice dinner the next day."
"3","This place has the potential to be great!! However, it's not. The chips and salsa and atmosphere are definitely a reason to go! The best I've ever had!!!! The first trip there provided a waitress who never brought the cheese dip we ordered. When I asked her to take it off our check, she said, \""ok\"".  Never an apology or \""oh my gosh! I forgot!\""  Nothing. She came by a couple of times to refill the empty water glasses them disappeared until the food and check were brought out. \n\nGiving them the benefit of the doubt, we went back the next day. Again, beautiful atmosphere from the patio. The chips and salsa were DELICIOUS!!!! The food and service were mediocre. I had the chicken sandwich which sounded somewhat healthy but came out greasy. \n\nSo my advice: go!! Get the chips and salsa. Although I didn't have one, I hear the margaritas are good, too. Enjoy the patio and beautiful Phoenix weather. Just don't expect too much from the rest of the food or service."
"3","The prices for the ride to the top, skyjump and other activities were a bit inflated for Vegas, I thought. For that reason, we didn't bother.\n\nThe casino was pretty average compared to other ones on the Strip. I ate brunch downstairs before my bus ride. The food was OK, but not incredible.\n\nWhat I did like was that the DEUCE drops you off right here and the bus to LA picks you up in the back of their building in the parking lot. That's quite convenient."
"5","This restaurant has never fail on my Dinner every time I go  with my family the food is always delicious and a great experience  \nI'm very happy with Yesterday Dinner was Delicious \nThe restaurant was very clean \nThe host,waitress ,and the rest of the staff was very nice specially a Spanish speaker man he took care of Us and made sure we had everything we needed"
"5","We walked by on our way to the Giants baseball game on Friday and it looked good, so we went for lunch today in the rain.  It was just wonderful. We sat on the back patio which was not crowded, even though it was pretty crowded inside.  Our waiter was pleasant, prompt, and helpful in explaining menu items.  I had the shrimp tacos and my husband had Huevos Rancheros.  We also ordered a side of the street corn.  It was one of the best meals we've had on this trip.  The rain added to the already lovely ambience.  \n\nThe tacos, in addition to tasting wonderful, looked just as good.  The presentation is clearly important to them.  The service was equally good. \n\nA great place for either lunch or dinner."
"1","I think if you're the average overweight American, then this place would be nice for you.  It's huge portion for the average price restaurant with food that will surely get you on the obese side fairly quickly.  My family and I went here because of the Yelp review, but I guess some reviews are not really helpful.  We ordered two dishes to share to see how good it is, but it was terrible.  The \""scramble eggs\"" are pre-made; yellow and dry and on the cold side for scramble eggs.  The scramble eggs with salmon was scramble, but they added the cold salmon and didn't really cook it anymore serving it on the cold side.  Also the salmon smells really \""fresh\"".  You can smell the fish smell and it was really bad; cold salmon.  Not to mentioned their \""abundant mix fruits\"" came only with 3 small slices of pineapple and 2 tiny pieces of oranges.  Serious now.  Most of the dishes you can tell are pre-made, hence you will get your dishes fairly quick.  I did mentioned to the waitress about the disappointment and she did offer to make a new one, but I just wanted to finish and move on.  One thing I don't trust is complaining to your server and mechanic and have the same people who originally jacked up their service to try and redo the same service.  You might get a surprise flavor in your scramble eggs or a loose bolt in your engine.  I rather just Yelp about it and eat somewhere else.  If you think about eating here, just go to a Dennys, unless you're weight challenge, you can get full here."
"3","Good enough for us to go back when we're feeling lazy but not good enough to rave about it.\n\nIt's fast, convenient and decent.\n\nAnd impossible to take a piss in. Seriously. 1 stall for like, 40-70 customers. I swear every time I need to take a leak or wash my hands, someone's in there--writing a novel on the crapper or something . . ."
"2","I was fooled by the reviews. This was my first time ever going to a laundromat, and from the reviews, this placed seems like they would help me figure it out. \nWell,  I took my comforter in to wash today and the lady working was overly rude when I asked her questions. And if I didn't catch it the first time, she started speaking to me in a slow, degrading manner. She also told me I needed the biggest, $6 washer, which was probably actually a little excessive, but oh well. \nAlso, well over half of the machines are out of order. And the place isn't very clean for a laundry facility. \nMaybe I just didn't come when the right employees were working, but these other reviews had my expectations a lot higher than they should have been."
"1","Pretentious and overrated.  The staff here seem to look down their noses at diners which is comical as this restaurant is located in a strip mall and its interior looks like a barn.  The food many on this site seem to like was overpriced and less than spectacular.  I have been there for dinner and brunch, and was disappointed by the fare and service both times. The turkey meatballs, which are touted as one of their specialties,  were tasteless and hard. The pizza dough was also hard and the toppings lacked any depth of flavor.  For brunch I ordered the  hash which was hands down the  absolute worst hash I ever had the misfortune to eat.  The cook must have known it was horrible as he tried to compensate by dousing  it with an enormous amount of salt.  One could get better tasting food at the  Cheesecake Factory  right across the street  at Boca Park without the snooty attitude and for far less money."
"4","Great atmosphere n great food. \nOn the pricey side."
"3","I really love the story behind this place. It's named for a small town in Ireland. It seems slightly excessive to build a place in Ireland and ship it to the States, but I still like it. \n\nThe atmosphere is great. I loved the different areas of the restaurant - one that looks like a cottage, one that looks like a church and, of course, the matchmaker's booth. The place is also really big. There are also two bars to saddle up to. The booths are a bit funky - high benches set far from the table - but the benches move so we just scooted ours closer.\n\nOn to the food. The menu is massive and offers all the Irish fare you'd want. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip to start. Good, but nothing great. Should have tried the fried brie (doesn't that sound awesome?!). I ordered the Gaelic-style chicken breast. I don't know what made it Gaelic, but it certainly was delicious. It was a saut\u00e9ed chicken breast smothered in a wild mushroom medley and Irish whiskey cream sauce served on a bed of champ potatoes (mashed potatoes) and vegetable of the day (carrots and string beans). The mushroom sauce is adapted from an old family recipe. That was the best part, in my opinion. I could have just had the mushroom sauce and been happy. My mother-in-law raved about the sliced chicken on her Irish salad. The glazed salmon was a little bit too sweet for me (glazed with a gingered molasses whiskey sauce) but it was cooked very nicely.\n\nFor an Irish pub, I thought the beer menu was a little lacking. I had a Four Peaks Kilt Lifter, but didn't really see much else that appealed to me (I think there were about 7 choices?). The various hot/after-dinner drinks sounded delicious but I didn't have room to try any of them. \n\nThe service was friendly. We went on a Sunday afternoon - between lunch and dinner. The place was pretty empty, but our waitress was attentive. Mostly. I did think it took slightly longer than it should for a second beer to be brought out after it was ordered.\n\nIf I lived in Phoenix, I'd go back every once in awhile."
"1","Terrible customer service. I wouldn't mind the prices so much if the service wasn't so horrible! I've been in a few times.. And every time is the same. Ignored, until finally someone comes to help and I'm treated like I'm wasting their time. I guess the 1500$ specialized bike my mom bought just wasn't pricy enough to get some attention. Won't buy anything again.."
"4","Holy credit card! This is a huge mall!\n\nAs other yelpers note, it has so many stores, eateries and parking.  It is clean.  The layout plan is a bit, um, difficult to grasp? is that a nice and accurate way to say it?  Especially with a baby stroller which means finding the ramp or elevator to get to the next, um, level-thingie.  I'm sure if I was more of a regular it would be a breeze.  Ala Moana would be a good comparison, except this mall is all indoor. \n\nNice, quiet (yes quiet), peaceful mall for the obvious reason that it is not that crowded...because there is a lot of space, unlike Ala Moana."
"1","I was looking forward to my appointment after seeing all the great reviews, but sadly disappointed after going here. The doctor was so sarcastic and came off rude. I should have just left but needed to get glasses soon so I ordered from them and it took over a month to get my glasses in...the office was nice and clean but I will definitely not be returning"
"2","Just average nothing great you can get the same food in any bar around town except bagels you can get those fresh at smiths if your hungry and have no other choice here's your place"
"3","Above average buffet. My wife and I went for breakfast and had a few good things like egg cooking station and the wide selection of cultural cuisines like Chinese, continental, japanese etc. service was average with a smile. But the quality of food was average and tables were left quite dirty for a long time. Edible but don't take your mama there on mothers day. Maybe take a friend"
"1","Rude welcoming by owner. Store was completely empty and owner yells from back of salon \""what do u need\"". Walked out before giving a dime to a business that doesn't understand service"
"4","It's a pity so many people have had such bad experiences at B&B. We visited on 3/23 and had a fantastic experience! We were running late for our 8 p.m. reservation that evening and called ahead to let them know we would be 10-15 minutes late. We actually arrived closer to 25 minutes late but the hostess was very gracious and told us that it was not a problem. We were seated immediately and our waitress was right over to take our drink orders. Before perusing the menu, our waitress let us know that we could ask her any questions we had about any of the plates as their menu is not very descriptive. We ordered two appetizers, Burrata (and I can't remember the other one), the Burrata was outstanding! \n\nAfter that we chose our pasta dishes, I had the Gnocchi with lamb ragu. I have never had lamb before and this was a perfect introduction. Overall the food was very good, not the best I've ever had but delicious none the less.\n\nWhat really stood out to us was the service. Our waitress and the rest of the wait staff were super attentive and always available to fulfill any request. \n\nWill be returning on future trips!"
"4","Great neighborhood sushi restaurant.  Happy hour is super cheap.  Buy a beer and get a 50cent app?  Sign me up!  My friend and I ordered around 10 rolls and orders of sushi plus a couple beers and our bill was only $50.  Sushi was fresh and good quality.  All the rolls we ordered were delicious.  4 stars only because the service was a little slow, but they only had 2 guys rolling sushi for the entire restaurant."
"4","I sat at the bar and had the tasting menu with the wine pairing.  As is typical with a tasting menu, some items weren't as good as others, but overall this was a fantastic meal.  I actually would have preferred slightly smaller portions for some of the courses because I was so incredibly full afterwards.  I'd say this is more accurately a 4.5.  Great for a special occasion."
"2","Well the chips and salsa were good while it lasted now been waiting 15 minutes for refills on our sodas and chips. I had to get up and find our server just to get those and he seemed upset that I even asked. Waiting on our food order to come which was taken about 20 more minutes. Oh did I mention we waited for a table for 25 minutes when they said 10 then we get shoved in the corner with a loud family blehh"
"2","I went here when I dropped my iPhone (tragedy...) and broke the speaker. I could hear my callers, but they couldn't hear me. I went in to Best Buy to see if I could just buy one of those cheap pay-as-you-go phones, because I had some urgent business calls to make, and had planned to be running around town all day. I looked around with a customer service rep, who was in fact friendly. But after some wasted time, we came to the conclusion that they had nothing to offer me.  In short, I have no problem with the customer service at this location. But I wish such a big chain would not forget to supply their stores with the simple/affordable options. This could be my old fashioned preference, but if I want to by a non-color screen flip phone, I'd hope I could find it at one of the biggest electronic stores in the nation."
"1","Had to come here to fill up my gas can because I ran out of gas on the freeway and so when I was filling up my ga can an employee ran outside and told me that can't fill up gas cans at our station and the employee pulled the nozzle and place it back on the pump and told me to leave. \n\n\nWorst experience I had ever had with any gas station. I'm from Ohio and me and my family were heading to red rock national park. DO NOT GO TO THIS STATION."
"2","Waited for ever for the host to appear. Never did. I had to walk into the restaurant and find myself a table. They need an complete overhaul of their staff. \n\nFood was standard thai. It was ok, nothing great though."
"2","....was not impressed... I know their menu is seasonal... but... it's just not that great. The Monkey bread was the best thing they had on the menu... and the first time I've ever seen Monkey bread on a menu, that's the only perk. It's a beautiful little place right next to the pool... and it's very small, just a heads up. The customer service wasn't  that great, it took forever to get our food and it wasn't even busy. My friend and myself sent our food back. She had the chicken and waffles and said it was horrible. I had a noodle soup thing... I went to fork my noodles out and a big clump of coagulated noodles came up on my fork... ICK! I sent it back and got the pulled pork sandwich. thankfully that was ok... just ok. I've had better... I wouldn't waste my time here, there's sooo many other great places to eat, but if you're craving some warm, honey, nutty Monkey bread... make the time to get some!"
"3","The environment is lively and the employees have fun at their jobs. The prices are reasonable and portions are huge. However, over the past year we have visited this restaurant which has been at least six times it almost a gurantee that we have to send our meat back whether it be the prime rib or steak and quite frankly it has gotten old because you originally wait for your meal and then wait again while its sent back causing your other food to get cold and overall you just end up not enjoying your meal. The last straw for me was when I called the restaurant on mothers day to inquire about the wait at 630PM. The gal said it was currently 40 minutes. I said perfect and made my reservation for 710PM. Upon checking in they told me it was a 20-30 minute wait.  I said what happened to the 40 minute wait that I was told when I called? The gal said that all call ahead seating does is cut your wait time in half. I told her that is crazy and that what she is telling me now is not what was told nor explained to me over the phone. All the gal could say was sorry man. Who calls their customers man?  So we walked over next door to Long Horn Steakhouse instead and spent our hard earned money there. We are done with Texas Roadhouse at least at Metro Center."
"5","Another great and honest service by Decatur Auto Electirc.  This is the 3rd time they have worked on my truck and have been resonable and honest each time.  Thank Luis and team for another job well done!  I will recomend you and be back with future issues I may encounter. Thanks, John"
"1","the toddy was good, the food not so much. it was pricey and there were a few too many flies buzzing around for my liking."
"4","Bisher nur ein Beitrag, und der ist nicht so wirklich positiv...\n\n\n Also: ich fands gut. \nAmbiente und Service fand ich eher mittelm\u00e4\u00dfig - aber typisch f\u00fcr ein Indisches Restaurant in Deutschland. \nSehr lange warten mussten wir aber nicht, nur 'etwas lange'.\n\n\n Aber ich fand das Essen sehr sehr schmackhaft. \nSehr w\u00fcrzig, angenehm scharf.\n\n\n Ich werde da auf jeden Fall noch ein zweites Mal hingehen und dann wieder berichten."
"2","My friend and I wanted to try a new place and didn't want to travel far from flamingo and 215 area. We enlisted Yelp to help us find a place to dine at. Shucks came to mind. After reading all the reviews this seemed to be THE place the be! so we decided to give it at shot. \n\nWhen you walk in you see is the bar, we looked for a hostess but there's a sign to seat yourself. On the right hand side is the bar with some high top tables to sit at and on the left there are tables and booths restaurant style. We decided to sit at a booth with a large table because we were planning on eating a lot of food. We were greeted by the waiter and he gave us some time to look at the menu. \n\nThere is a pretty good selection of seafood and other items such as sandwiches and pasta to choose from. My friend and I went for the seafood. We ordered 1/2 a dozen raw oysters on the shell, 1/2 lb of black mussels, 1/2 lb of manila clams, 1 lb of snow crab legs, garlic french fries, and a crab and spinach dip. seasonings for the seafood we choose lemon and garlic. \n\nThe food didn't take too long to come out except for our garlic fries. First, came the crab and spinach dip. Consistency was different than what I'm used to. It was a little runny and had a strong sea food taste from the crab. I'm used to this dip being a little thicker and more creamy.  We had to add some hot sauce, salt and pepper to the appetizer so it wouldn't taste as bland. The chips that came with it were almost a cross between a tortilla and a pita bread. \nNext came the oysters. Those were delicious. White meat not cloudy and didn't smell fishy. Then the rest of our food arrived.\n\n Everything smelled so GOOD and mouth watering but when we started slurping and eating everything our noses deceived us. The food smelled so tasty and aromatic but it did not taste the same way. Weird right? I guess we are so used to eating at Hot 'n' Juicy. We finished our meal and I totally didn't even notice that our garlic fries never came out. We flagged down the waiter and asked them if they forgot it? He went to check and said the cooks forgot but it seemed like he forgot to ring it in. \n\nThe fries came out about 5 minutes later super oily and shiny with some sort of garlic white powder on top of them. I didn't even want to eat it. I tried one and the moment I bit into it I felt like an oil bubble bursted into my mouth.\n\nThis place is nice and clean but the service was a little poor. They only had 2 table sitting in that area with 2 servers serving as well.  The price is good for what you get especially since it is seafood. \n\nSo if you are looking for something close in the area with mediocore seafood. This will be the spot."
"3","Isn't it great when a new Buffet pops up?  Today I had the pleasure of trying this one for the first time, accompanied by Robyn N. & Norm R.  This place appeared in the shell formerly occupied by Crazy Buffet #2, and they don't seem to have changed it much, if at all, except that it's slightly less expensive.  Here were some other observations on this visit:\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n*  Nice dining room.\n*  Friendly staff.\n*  Reasonable prices.\n*  Most food items properly identified.\n*  Proper lighting for both the food and the dining room.\n*  Big selection of 111 food items plus sauces & dressings.\n*  Medium selection of tasty Sushi.\n*  Good Mongolian style BBQ with 4 meats & treats including water chestnuts, bamboo, etc.\n\n\nA FEW SHORTCOMINGS:\n\n*  It was too warm inside.\n*  They didn't have quite all of the food out at 11 AM opening time.\n*  Their drinking water had a snarky taste.  It needs filtering.\n*  The Sushi table didn't have separate tongs for each item, including the meats.\n*  The soft ice cream machine was out of order.\n\nThey need to tighten things up a little here but overall I think it's a nice place.\n\nWeekday Lunch Buffet:  $7.99/$7.19 Sr."
"2","In a word...yuk. Ordered takeout. If you like frozen pizza taste with a cardboard crust and canned sauce this is your place. Maybe kids would like it, but not adults who have ever eaten a good pizza."
"3","This place was surprisingly good, considering it's at a food court. After a long night of partying, I really wanted some hangover food.... and I found it! \n\nAt first glance, I thought this place was your typical fast-food chinese place, but when I looked at the menu, I saw that they serve udon - yumm! I ordered the tempura udon and my boyfriend had the seafood soup. The broth was super hot and reallyyyy soothing. It didn't have a ton of flavor but I didn't really mind - I just wanted something hot. The noodles seemed pretty fresh and were also really good. The udon came with 3 tempura shrimps. It was a bit heavy on the batter but it was alright when I soaked it in the soup first. For $8, it wasn't a bad meal.\n\nI think I read on someone else's review that they charge $0.10 for water? The lady that helped us was really nice and gave us 2 cups of it for free."
"3","There is a waiting line if u want to dine on the patio, you can wait at the bar and spend $11 for a Mimosa or spend your money gambling in the casino. Or just wait till the buzzer calls you, but then, why did you come to Vegas for? Great place to people watch and have an overpriced sliced tomato with some stinky cheese called salad. The quiche is good too, if you like quiches. You get a baguette and some butter to start with, but don't spend too much, just enjoy the good weather and the funny dressed tourists taking pictures of the Eiffel tower."
"1","Our German Shepard got a hemotoma in his ear.  It's basically blood filling his ear flap.  We took him here because it's the closest vet to our home.  As far as the visit itself, it was average.  The only treatment they did was to drain the blood with a needle.  No big deal, figured ok, issue resolved, keep pressure on it and it will eventually heal.  WRONG!  After doing some research online and calling other vets, what they did was basically pointless, the ear is filling back up with blood and the issue will have to be fixed with surgery in order to resolve it permanently.  Guess what this POINTLESS treatment cost...$400!!!!  The exam itself was $75 and a flippin' bandage was $53!!  We are FURIOUS!!  Not only did they do nothing to solve the issue, they completely took advantage of us in our worry for our dog.  We have called for quotes for the actual surgery that will resolve the hemotoma to several other vets in the area and the surgery will actually be less expensive than what these ridiculous people charged us for doing jack-sh!t.  Oh!  And when we called them to tell them the hematoma came back they wanted to charge us $40 for the follow-up.  If you have any concern for finances, DO NOT GO HERE!"
"1","This is located inside the Planet Hollywood, downstairs, and right in front of the valet and hotel registration area.\n\nSLOWEST SERVICE EVERRR...\n\nValet said it would take 20 minutes to retrieve my car, so i had to kill time somehow. Looked around, saw SB, and there was only 7 people in line. Little did i know that it would take 20 minutes to get my coffee!\n\nSmall fruit cup = $5, OUCH.\n\nDon't come here if you're in a hurry."
"3","It was a nice zoo but VERY small. And I mean extremely small. I've been to free zoos that have more to offer. You could walk through that zoo in 5 minutes if you continues through at a consistent pace. Not many animals and they missed out on some really cool animals. Not worth the price in my opinion."
"3","Curving around the corner of Cockburn St is the Malt Shovel. This is one of few pubs nearby with a local clientele and an attractive spot waiting for a train, given its handy location near Waverley Station.\n\nThe Malt Shovel has an attractive green painted exterior. Inside it has a traditional atmosphere, although the pub itself is more modern. There are a number of levels in this pub, not floors, different rooms with slightly different decor. \n\nThis pub offers food from lunch time to evening, with standard pub meals on offer. The pub is well known for its extensive selection of single malt whiskies. It also offers live music throughout the week, which might not always be as appealing as some of the other well known folksy bars in Edinburgh, but still makes for a more interesting evening."
"4","I love this salon! When I moved to the area I tried several salons and was always disappointed either by the crappy work or by the outrageous prices. I ended up trying here simply because either was near my home and it is amazing! Frankie always does a great job on my acrylics, and the price and quality of their pedicures are unbeatable. The only reason I rated 4 stars is because they always seem to have only one nail tech so if he is busy you are stuck waiting. But it's worth it!"
"5","Secured Auto Glass is a rarity in Las Vegas.  Very honest, low prices and exceptional service.  I though you would only find a company like this in a small midwest town.\n\nAsh, the owner, is a great guy and answered all my question.  I had my front windshield replaced.  I was in and out of there in an hour.\n\nI highly recommend them for your auto glass repairs. I would give him 10 stars if I could!"
"2","I've sat in the restaurant once and in the bar area a few times. First off, all the sports on all the walls: AWESOME!!!!!! You can come in and watch a few games at the same time and just enjoy a couple hours of entertainment. That entertainment does come with a price, though. \n\nThe food is meh. I really can't describe it. It's there. It's edible. That's about it. It is fun to try the varity of wing sauces, though. Some of them can get pretty pontent! The service is meh+. We were kinda rushed out the day we were in the dining room, and I've had to wait waaaaaay to long for a beer, hell even to get acknowledged at the bar. The prices hurt a little bit, but I guess they do have to pay for their sports packages and you don't have to. The fact that you can buy bottles of their sauces is a huge plus. Their bold anti-2A stand point is very off putting, but a lot of patrons go to drink and drinking and carrying is a big no-no. That should be something that the state regulates, though and BWW shouldn't police the innocent. \n\nThis place is walking distance from the house (albeit a long one, up a hill), which is a huge saving grace for them."
"4","Nice little place with a wide variety of food on the menu. Sitting on the patio was awesome. The sliders were amazing and I would defiantly come back again."
"2","Not impressive.  Adequate service, but for the price the menu items lacked attention to detail. No guarana.  Feijoada is not very authentic.   Pao de queijo a bit heavy.  Meats were a little bland in flavor. Salad bar had good variety, though.  A little limited selection in the meats compared to other similar Brazilian steakhouses."
"1","Looks like Sandra C and Jay G experienced the same horrible service as we did.  Sunday around 9am.  They were not that busy but had severabl people waiting outside and empty tables inside.  The check in person asked for a cell phone to text us when the table was ready, yet called out names for others.  People that came after us were seated before us since we did not have our cell phone in hand to know they text us and called names for others. When we were going to be seated outside and asked if we could take one of the EMPTY tables under the umbrella, we were told they were not being waited on.  We asked for an EMPTY table in the corner that was BETWEEN 2 tables that had patrons at (would assume the waitress that was serving those tables could serve the EMPTY table) but were told we would have to wait 5 minutes before they could assing a waitress to our table.  We asked if we could wait while sitting at the EMPTY table.  That bothered the hostess but she allowed us to sit there.  And...YES... we waited... longer than 5 minutes as waitresses passed up our table to wait on the tables around us.  After ordering, the coffee took forever to come--- in paper cups because they ran out of actual coffee cups...with a LESS than packed house....guess that means if they are full at breakfast time...EXPECT TO GET YOUR COFFEE IN PAPER CUPS. The food was delivered...3 of the 4 of us had food.  I tasted my food while we waited...it was COLD.  The food would have been good if it has at least been warm.\nCustomer service of check in and seating, service at the table, food prep and delivery all need attention."
"5","Overall I had a wonderful experience when visiting the salon for the first time. I came into the salon and was greeted by the attendant to wait for my stylist. I had my haircut scheduled with Vanessa and she was punctual on time. I was looking for a trim on my layers and a polished look - and it was done! After that I had asked Vanessa if she had room for a walk-in service right after me, as my mother was looking to get her hair cut (she had gotten it colored at another salon the same day, and it was her day off, so she doesn't have a lot of time on her hands). Luckily Vanessa was able to accommodate her the same day and we both came out with gorgeous, fresh hair cuts done! We will both be back again, thank you Canyon Falls and Vanessa for being so accommodating!"
"1","Are you serious? This place is terrible. Out of all the places you can go see a movie in Vegas - don't come here! This theater is terrible. The only reason I am giving one star is because I have to, and I guess because my boyfriend and I were 2 of 6 people in the movie we went to here.\n\nNo stadium seating. It's 2012. Get stadium seating.\n\nTiny movie screen, bright annoying overhead lights, seats that are terribly uncomfy, and a sad little snack bar. \n\nI got a Groupon for buy one get one tickets here. I received the tickets in the mail and decided to see Act of Valor. When I arrived at the theater I was greeted with the fact that I had to shell out $1.50 extra per ticket because I was seeing a movie that was less than 2 weeks old. Gee, thanks AMC and GROUPON. See if I ever use your services again."
"2","My fianc\u00e9 and I were walking down the strip with my sister and decided to get a drink. We passed this place and I decided I wanted to try it because of the fire on the tables. Yeah, that was a deciding factor for me lol. My fianc\u00e9 got an adios mother fuc*er and my sister and I got a strawberry daiquiri. My fianc\u00e9s drink was strong and well work the money while my sister and I's drinks were just overpriced slushies. Pretty disappointing since it was my sister's first drink ever and because I can get buzzed off of an 8oz. glass of wine. My fianc\u00e9 even asked the waitress if there was any alcohol or if it was a virgin. According to her, it had 10%, same as a beer. I get buzzed off of a beer so they must have forgotten to put the alcohol in. Pretty disappointing. We won't be returning unfortunately."
"5","We love this place when we come to Las Vegas.  Highly recommended for the steaks!"
"2","Alright.... So where do I start... For starters I work in retail, I hear about reviews every day and I have never felt the need to write a review for service reasons till now. So I suggest that you pay attention to my review because I am not an angry customer/ tenant going around writing bad reviews. After reading the reviews listed above, you will see similarities to back up my review. When I first moved into Flagstone I was very excited due to great customer service and seeing their show room apartment, after a couple of weeks the joyful management could care less who lived in their complex, repairs and service needs were not taken care of in a nice timely manor weeks and months would go by before anything would get done. As far as their \""UPGRADES\"" that they up charge you for are bottom of the barrel coming from someone who works in the industry crappy coats of white primed cabinets and not even an IKEA worthy laminate counter top to finish it off, beware of the \""upgraded\"" bathtub walls they are a cheap vinyl vi-near that will tear at the seams from steam from your shower.  Flagstone claims that they are a gated community FALSE their left gate remains open 100% of the time before and after office hours my vehicle was broken into at night along with Several other one car was even put on blocks.. How could something like this happen in a gated community with night patrol? you are putting the cube in the circle on this one, what makes this worse my car was almost broken into a second time during the day time, both times I went to notify the office exact response \"" Sorry we can not do anything about this, have you contacted the police if not you should\"" that put a great big smile on my face. A week after I broke my lease, on my move out date I stayed til midnight cleaning the apartment to an T  to make less work for the maintenance men because that's the type of person I am, and instead of dropping the keys in the late deposit box I returned them the next day in person to thank them for allowing me to stay there, but guess what the associate charged me for an extra day because I didn't drop the keys in the deposit box the night before which is apparently okay to do. To sum up my review up don't give in to what they sell its a money game to them your personal well being means nothing to them.\n\nThank you for reading my review I hope this saves you money and peace of mind."
"3","Ramen Bar is a welcome addition of Japanese food to the Pittsburgh area. Unfortunately, me and my roommate are both from California, so we have very high expectations of ramen.\n\nThe portion were a bit on the small side, and the flavor wasn't anything spectacular. They charge extra for things that are usually given in normal ramen--like egg, etc. \n\nThe decor was cute and the servers were nice. The food wasn't anything special though so I doubt I will feel a need to head back to Ramen Bar with so many better Asian restaurants surrounding it."
"5","I hereby declare my love for Mini Quesadillas, and everything else they offer here. Great food"
"2","After reading some positive reviews I wanted to try Buddy V's for some decent Italian food. It's a nice place with a nice view of the strip, with the neon lights flickering in the background. Here is what we had:\n- Grandmas Meatballs. These were pretty tast but our order was cold. I know they are not made to order  but you expect them to be warm.\n-Calamari Fritti. You basic calamari with 2 slivers of a banana pepper and grilled lemon. Another dish that came out cold.\n-Lisa V's Linguini and white clam sauce. This dish has the most balanced flavors and a decent amount of clams. This was the 3rd dish in a row that was cold. I would have mentioned it to our server but he wasn't around much.\n-My mother in laws shrimp scampi. The one dish that came out warm . It had pretty good flavors but not the best scampi I ever had. My mother in laws is much better!.\n\nWhere most authentic Italian restaurants might offer you freshly grated parm you had to ask for it and it took a few minutes to let the food get even colder. We also asked for some bread, mainly for the scampi since it had a nice broth build up in the bottom of the bowl. The waiter looked as if I was asking for ketchup at a steak house. Another dissapointing Italian meal in Las Vegas, my search continues!"
"4","I walked here from jury duty since I was hungry but felt like I deserved a treat. It was definitely worth the 6-minute walk from RJC and 12-minute walk back to my car.\n\nThey were closing in an hour when I got here so I want sure why the hostess was hesitant to give me a table where I can charge my phone that was out of juice. No group of more than 4 people showed up the entire time I was there and there were sure more empty tables than the one my appetite and I occupied. I didn't get service until somebody saw my Grumpy Cat look on. They were apologetic about it and they tried to overcompensate by telling me they have a new employee and everyone was checking up on me every 5 minutes when I just shoved food in my mouth.\n\nI ordered a few items enough for 3 people. People who passed by stared at my food. One actually said, \""wow, that's a lot of food!\"" I'm aware.\n\nGreen Juice:\nApples, cucumber, lemon, zucchini, green pepper, celery and baby spinach. This was pretty good. If you don't mind the taste of celery, you'd love this. 3.5/5\n\nApple Rings:\nThey look like doughnuts but it doesn't have a lot if dough at all. They're filled with apple rings drizzled with cinnamon glaze served piping hot. 5/5\n\nFat Elvis:\nThick French toast with peanut butter, bacon, bananas and Nutella inside and dusted with powdered sugar, with berries on the side. You'll feel extremely fat after a few bites but it's delicious so, you'll end up with mixed emotions of guilt and happiness. 4/5\n\nBroccoli:\nEgg white skillet with spinach, broccoli on top of potatoes. This was good but a bit oily. 4/5\n\nI would say my experience was 3.5 stars. But they actually give back to the community. They help Childhood Cancer/ Leukemia so, I'll give the extra half a star for that."
"5","Sake-To-Me!\nLiterally! So I should have called Sangeetha to tell her I was coming here, but I just stopped by after a visit to Tokyo Discount...\nGreg and Miko warmly welcomed me, and when they learned I was engaged, I got cold unfiltered sake on the house!  yum.  \nMy meal consisted of the long-awaited spicy tuna bowl with soft shell crab on top, nimono, and saba sashimi, plus matcha iced tea (surprise, surprise).\nThe bowl: soooo good, fulfilled my cravings.  The soft shell crab was very crispy and tasty, but not greasy at all.  This was served beautifully with cucumbers, masago, lemon slices, and daikon.\nThe nimono: This is basically Japanese comfort food.  Daikon, carrot, potato, taro, fish cake, and maybe burdock cooked in dashi-esque broth.  Warm, soft, delish...\nThe saba: Cured to perfection, delicate but flavorful, cut by the master.  I ate the daikon and the perilla leaf too.\nThe tea and sake: satisfying counterbalances :)\nand yes, it was packed in there fairly late on a Thursday!\nLook for an upcoming UYE one of these days, super-vegetarian-friendly!"
"4","Although we had to wait 30 minutes for a table, it was well worth it. We sat outside, which is beautiful and great for people watching. I ordered a caesar salad and within what seemed like five minutes it was on the table. It was delicious, I loved the cheese and dressing. I also ordered the classic quiche lorraine. I'm a big sucker for quiche, my grandmother made it countless times for me when I was little and I have to say eating this quiche sent me back to my childhood. It was AMAZING..and incredibly filling. I couldn't even finish all of it!\n\nOur waiter was very friendly and attentive. Not only that but the food comes out so quickly that I barely had time to finish my caesar salad before my lunch was served. My boyfriend got the warm chicken and brie sandwich. It had thin slices of apple and caramelized onions on top. Absolutely delicious.  All in all a great experience, great food and an elegant yet not pretentious atmosphere. When we go back to Vegas we will definitely be dining here again."
"4","Would have a had a 5-star if the wait and service was better.\n\nFood is amazing. They deliver on the twisted farm food promise.  \n\nThe fried sage fried chicken and the chicken and waffles were very impressive."
"4","This place gets a 4.5 Stars!\n\nI played on these fields twice for softball tournaments. One was for the ASA softball Worlds that they hosted and the other was most recently the ASA Hispanic Worlds Tournament. Both experiences have been great. Several well kept softball fields, sand volleyball courts, batting cages and bar/lounge area were one can have accessibility to watch the games. It seems to have ample parking lot, so I don't think parking will be a problem.\n\nI believe there is an entrance fee of $3.00 dollars. At Big League Dreams they charge $3.00 for entrance fee, but they give you a free drink token as well. I don't recall Victory Lane doing that.\n\nOverall great park and environment! A great sports venue!!!"
"4","I'm torn between shouting from the rooftops about how much I love Arrivederci's happy hour and keeping it as my own little secret so it doesn't become overcrowded.  Well . . . here it goes, fingers crossed!\n\nWe had been here for dinner a few times and were very pleased, we decided we needed to try their happy hour.  I'm so glad we did; this is one of my new favorite quiet happy hour spots.  Not quite as trendy as Va Bene, but that's a good thing.  Less of a singles scene, less noisy and the food is just as delicious!  Happy hour is M-F 5-7.\n\nWe walked in a few minutes after 5 and were greeted by a very friendly bartender.  He kindly brought us menus and explained that during happy hour all wines by the glass are $5.  Wonderful!! He brought us some water (with a slice of cucumber, nice touch), took our drink orders, and gave us a few minutes to decide on food.\n\nIn addition to the wine specials, there are happy hour food specials! Half off bruschetta, pizza, and other appetizers.  We went with the Calamari In Umido (large tube calamari saut\u00e9ed in white wine & clam broth with a touch of tomato) and the Margherita pizza. They make their own mozzarella here, people!!\n\nBefore we received the appetizers, the bartender gave us some fresh bread with oil and balsamic to snack on.  The calamari came out first and it was fabulous, as was using the free bread to sop up the amazing broth!  Then came the pizza and while it didn't blow me away, it was still very good and that mozzarella is so creamy and fresh!  \n\nAs embarrassed as I am to admit it, we got three rounds of that yummy bread to use for that delicious broth of the calamari.  The best part, the bartender didn't seem to mind a bit that we were being a little greedy with the free bread!  What a nice guy!  Did I mention the bread and broth were delicious?\n\nThe bar area is nice with a small-ish size bar and a few high-top tables.  My favorite part was the living room set up past the bar.  Some comfy couches and a projection screen.  I can't wait to plan a friendly group happy hour so we can lounge around on the couches drinking wine and snacking on appetizers.\n\nThe service was great, the food was great, the price was right, and the atmosphere is cool and cozy.  What more can a girl ask for?  A couple more times like this, and this is a five star rating . . . easy!"
"5","Great place, if you live in the area and plan to go alot,a.season pass is a good investment, considering a one time ticket is like $28.00. A all year pass for an adult is $100.00 and for kids $50.00. We love going there! the god is expensive so I always pack snacks and water. (they say ur not supossed to) but I always have! Bring change to feed the giraffes ,koi, ducks, and fish!"
"4","I can't give a Cirque show less than 4 stars, but this was definitely the runt of the litter (at least out of the three shows we've seen). Mystere had its moments, but there were far too many lulls in the action. O is WAY more exciting and worth the extra price. Kooza (a traveling show that we saw in Los Angeles) was also better. Still, if you can swing discount tickets, Mystere is worth an evening -- but I wouldn't pay full price."
"2","I've been here 3 times with the in-laws and it really is not very good, not bad mind you but not what i want from mexican food. I would call this more mexicali food with a lot more Cali than Mexi. Good for those that don't like much spice or real Mexican food. There is always a wait on weekends."
"4","Friendly Donut is another favorite donut shop of locals.  A family friend has been raving about them for years and we finally took her advice. And yes, the donuts were good. \n\nIts tucked away in the corner of an old strip mall right in-between a shoe repair shop and a chiropractor. Just look for the simple DONUTS signage. You would pass them buy if you looked only at the store fronts. The interior decor was exactly what I would expect from a good donut shop...simple, a few random pictures, a Buddah statue,  bamboo plants, a advertising board for local business, and a few old tables and chairs. Don't ever judge a donut shop by their dirty tables...judge them by how many people are sitting at those tables! In the mornings, Friendly's has their regulars that will walk thru the door and the lady behind the counter already knows what to get them. On any given morning you'll see all the regular old timer HotRod builders  having donuts talking shop. And you get to check out their cool cars out front.\n\nNow on to the goods...The donuts were similar to another donut shop, I won't name drop...but it rhymes with Donalds Robots LOL! We always pick up a dozen or two of misc of donuts and just take a bite from each one...but our favorites are the maple bars. Its light and fluffy with a delicious glaze. The chocolate covered bars are also good. I'm not a big bear claw fan, but I loved it. It was a good combo of donut and the right amount of flavorful apple fillin...it was just right.. My wife loves the cinnamon roll, its pretty big fluffy donut with a nice taste of cinnamon and glaze.  My in-laws love the Bavarian cream and so does all the old timers who frequent the place. We just tried their maple covered buttermilk donuts and WOW...I think we found ourselves another favorite. We here the apple fritters are good but we haven't tried them yet.\n\nPick up your donuts in the AM (they are open 7 days a week from 4am-10pm), its fresh and you won't be disappointed. Plus you'll have a better selection. The donuts are also CHEAP...I recently picked up a dozen mixed and a dozen donut holes for under $10.00...not bad. And another tip: CASH ONLY! not to worry their are many ATM/ Banks on Boulder Hwy.\n\nFriendly's is right up there with the best of Las Vegas donut shops and it would hang with any of the LA donut shops. Shame on the people who say that Las Vegas has crappy donut shops...here's a tip- you won't find a good donut shop on the LV strip. Look with your mouth not with your eyes.\n\nAloha"
"2","The food wasn't the problem, had the buffet on a Saturday afternoon, and there was plenty of pizza, breadsticks, salad, etc. But I was unaware that I should have brought my own 2 liter of pop. The waitress, Carolynne was BAD, never came to the table at ALL. But did stop at one of the tables near by many times. Now she maybe a good waitress but if she's has more than 1 table your in trouble!!!"
"5","GET THE LARGE PEPPERONI & MUSHROOM WITH DOUBLE MOZZARELLA, you will want left-overs ! \n\nTucked in between Kona Grill and Gordon Bierch is the pizzeria that made the Brooklyn Bridge famous and now you can experience EXCELLENT NY pizza here on the West Coast without waiting in a long ass line with tons of tourists on Old Fulton Street.  Just park in the strip mall and head towards the fountain and you will find one of the greatest pizzerias in Summerlin (the other one is Rocco's by Costco).  I'm born & raised NY and my taste buds have been in training all my life, I know Great Pizza.\n\nThis thin crust is cracker crisp and will stay perfectly horizontal even without folding.  Here is what separates the Grimaldi style from others: \n1. They place fresh HANDMADE mozzarella slices (not shredded) on the crust FIRST\n2. Sauce is drizzled on top after the toppings (white pizza does not even have sauce)\n3. Oven temperature is HOTTER than hell which can soar up to 1200 degrees.  This coal oven brick pizza gives the crust that distinct charred flavor and crispiness.  Look under the crust and you will see the color that's different.  \n4. Pepperoni are little tiny salty slices which crisp up a bit.  SOOO GOOOD\n5. When you have been in the pizza business this long, you know that there are key factors that people connotate with excellent pizza: New York style, NY water, sauce, cheese, oven temperature, etc.  Grimaldi re-creates the NY style of water by re-creating the exact mineral content of Brooklyn water to make sure the dough is just like NY.\n\nThe coal brick oven is a goldmine and permit nightmare in NYC.  It wasn't possible to install a coal brick oven in Manhattan where Grimaldi originally wanted to open his pizzeria, so he opened up in Brooklyn (coal ovens had to be grandfathered in from the building).  Under the bridge on Old Fulton Street is famous, but now with the latest lease controversy, there is the new location around the corner from the original.  Back in 1904 Lombardi opened a brick oven pizza in SOHO and you can also wait in line to compare.  In March 2012, Juliana's will be opening up in NY as another Grimaldi spin off."
"5","Best foot spa I have been to in AZ!  Exceptional service and top notch massage"
"5","This place is just so cool.\n\nThe space is amazing - an indoor/outdoor, sprawling quarter block that includes various rooms in a converted bungalow, plus lots of outdoor decks, nooks, and crannies. The crowd is varied and chill - not a frat boy in sight for miles. Heat lamps, twinkly lights, booths, tables, and benches; something for everyone.\n\nThey're often crazy busy and should have more waitstaff to keep things moving at times. Plus the menu is totally standard and unremarkable barfare served reasonably cheap. If you're interested in fast as lightning service at all times and an adventurous menu full of organic locally grown ingredients, RUN! But if you want to hang out with your friends under the stars and over a beer for hours on end in the coolest space ever, this is heaven."
"2","Nothing special about this place. The food is ok and the service is slow. Not enough space between tables so its almost like your having dinner with the tables next to you."
"5","We recently moved to midtown Phoenix and needed to find a new cat sitter.  It's always hard to give someone you just met a key to your home and leave town, but after reading the previous reviews on Yelp I decided to give Jen a call and I'm glad I did.  She came over as promised to meet with us and took notes about our needs and a few days later off we went for a weekend get-a-away.  We had a little problem as I gave her the wrong key (totally my fault) but it all worked out in the end.  Oh, and our kitty even got a report card and a new kitty toy (left by Jen).  Jen's our new go-to when we have to leave town.  Thanks for everything Jen!"
"1","Absolutely horrible. Spent $1000 to rent a 2014 Jaguar XJL for 2 days. Brought it back on time and full of gas. 3 days later I'm getting over $1200 worth of charges on my card from Hertz. Then a day later an automated \""urgent\"" phone call saying I never returned the car. Seriously?!? It takes 4 days for them to realize an $85,000.00 luxury car wasn't returned??? Considering it was already returned, I don't know what's worse. The fact that is was and they had no clue or the fact that it took a machine 4 days to call me asking about it. After multiple attempts to reach the people at the actual Hertz desk at the airport without going through the 800 number and talking to someone in Michigan. I finally had to take time out of my day to drive back down to the airport only to wait in line and then speak to a manager. Never in my life have I met a more lazy, incompetent, unapologetic manger (Veronica). When I walked up she was sitting down in her chair at the desk(no other employee was sitting even though they all had chairs at their computers) I explain the situation and she proceeds to make 4 different phone calls trying to locate the \""unreturned\"" car. After she finds it she informs me it was put to the side so parts could be ordered for it. She asks the person on the other line if she needs to charge me for the parts? Yes apparently I stole the cupholder out of the jag which they valued at $80. Yea ya know they're right that jaguar cup holder just looks and fits so good in my Mercedes. (If you didn't pick up on it that was sarcasm)\n\nAfter much argument she told me I chose coverage for the car when I rented it so I'm not responsible for the cupholder. After wasting quite enough time I asked for a printed invoice of my final bill. She then says she doesn't have a printer. Really you don't have a printer? There is literally over 20 computers at the hertz desk. \""I don't have a printer but she does\"" pointing to an employee next to us helping other people. Bottom line is she was to lazy to stand up and move to one of the other 18 open computers and print my receipt. She told another guy to walk over and do it. Bottom line she was incredibly rude, lazy, disrespectful and made no attempt to offer an apology for the huge mistake and waste of time on my part. After asking at the very end \""so no apology what so ever? She offered a measly \""sorry\"" \n\nVeronica please do us all a favor and resign or learn some basic manners, take a little more initiative and learn to offer an apology when you know your company is in the wrong."
"4","A collection of Art, Music, Food, Drink, and good times.....First Friday is a monthly event held in the Downtown Las Vegas arts district.  I'm not sure if you can call it a 'district', but it's the closest thing Vegas has to what outsiders and new residents refer to as 'culture'.  The streets are blocked off and food vendors, art vendors, galleries, and music stages pepper the surrounding area......think of a massive block party or small festival.\n\nI enjoy coming down here with the family from time to time to check out the scene.  It gets really crowded, so it's difficult to really appreciate the art if you're into a more quiet and calm setting like I am.  One First Friday I saw a guy smoking inside the Arts Factory gallery.....that's crazy, the smoke can ruin the artwork!  Of course, nobody said anything to him.....and when I mentioned it, he gave me a \""who the F___ are you?!\"" look and walked away.  *sigh*  Some people come to First Friday for the party and not the art.....that's cool, but not really my style.\n\nThere's a lot of local musicians represented down here and a few stages where they perform.....it's kind of cool to see local bands perform since there aren't too many places in Vegas to listen to them.  There's usually a few food trucks and concession stands as well as restaurants down here.  We rarely eat at the event though as the lines can get very long and we don't really enjoy our meals when there's nowhere to sit and enjoy the food.  Definitely worth a trip if you've never been before though.\n\nSome TIPS:\n\n- Parking is very difficult to find.  There is paid valet parking at the Arts Factory on the corner of Charleston & Main St, but it fills up quickly.  Street parking close to the event is sometimes hard to find too.....my recommendation is to get there early or be patient to find a spot.\n\n- Wear comfortable shoes.  The First Friday event covers a few city blocks, so if you want to get the full experience be prepared to walk.\n\n- Bathrooms are a premium.  Because of the large crowds, expect long waits at the restroom.  The Arts Factory has one, some of the smaller galleries around the area won't let you use their private bathroom....keep that in mind.\n\n- If you bring your kids, make sure you keep an eye on them.  It's easy to lose them in the crowd and remember that you're on the streets of Downtown Las Vegas.....not a cool place to lose your kid at night.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty cool experience if you know what to expect.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%"
"5","We love this place!!!\nMainly because we got a season pass at the very beginning of the season which made going their so much cheaper!!  With the season pass we paid only $10 more than the day pass and got free parking for the season. \n\nYes the lines can be long and yes the food is really expensive but that is why you plan ahead.  Go on a day that makes more sense to be there and you can stay late, weekdays and Friday/ Saturday are the best we found.  Friday and Saturday because they close at 10 and you can beat a lot of the long lines.  \nBring a cooler and keep it in the car, that helps on prices of food.  \n\nI really don't understand all of the complaints.  It is a large water park where you can tell the people who work there are doing the best they can to help every person."
"2","Priceline has recently updated this hotel to four stars. Are they serious?!\nI don't know what their criteria is for rating hotels, but I suspect they just wanted to have a second 4-star rated hotel listed for the convention center area. How could they possibly rate this Motel-6-like motel with the 4-star Renaissance hotel a couple of blocks away?\nI suppose this hotel merits 2 stars on it's own, and you only spent $30 a night for it. However, if one bases one's rating on Priceline calling it a 4-star hotel, it only deserves a single star. \nAlthough I had already prepaid for this hotel, and couldn't get a refund, I reserved a room elsewhere as soon as I saw the room. I never even stayed the night. Very disappointing - and it made my trip that much more expensive, since I ended up paying for two separate hotels."
"1","Wanted to like this joint...yelp reviewers were positive...but sheesh, cannot\nrecommend anything.  Service was awful & taco corn tortillas were hard &\nbrittle.  Fillings were below par too."
"3","The buffet for Saturday night is 26.95 per person as of this writing. I would consider it a good deal at 20, but 27 is a bit too high. Some food was fantastic. The steak and salmon were very good, and the peanut butter chocolate cream pie was fantastic, rich but not heavy. One standout low was the so-called French onion soup, which was made with (I kid you not) reconstituted onions, almost identical to the grody ones McDonald's puts on its burgers. A cup of Lipton instant soup would have been better. I suppose that would be (barely) okay for a 7 dollar cheap ass buffet, but wholly unacceptable when dropping close to 30 dollars for a meal.  Fresh onions just aren't that expensive, and while a good French Onion soup takes a while to make, it's not labor intensive at all and an acceptable one should be easily in reach of any certificate holder from a culinary school. \n\nBasically, I'm reinforcing what others have said; what's good is very good, what's not good is downright bad."
"2","I hate to give this place a 2 star review based on some things that are not their fault but the truth of the matter is that I have had better accommodations elsewhere and at other Hamptons.  \n\nI picked this Hampton because it was close to where I needed to be, not too far from the strip/food and it was close to the airport...that last one is what got me.  It's VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY close to the airport.  I mean very close.  Like, look out your window and there's a jumbo jet close.  \n\nSo the planes landing and taking off at all hours of the night?  You can hear all of it.  It gets so bad that the windows shake at times and if you're a light sleeper then you probably aren't sleeping.  They provide you with ear plugs but...how will I hear my alarm with those ear plugs in?\n\nAnyhow, the staff is really nice and the breakfast isn't bad at all.  But the problem comes from location and it's proximity to the runway.  If you like watching and hearing airplanes take off at all hours of the night, this is the place for you.  For me?  Not so much."
"5","I used to tell people I don't eat sweets. Now I tell people I don't eat sweets except for cupcakes from Butter and Me.\n\nKelly's cupcakes are amazing. I have never tasted any icing that can compare to her butter cream. The cake has the perfect consistancy. \n\nI have tried cupcakes that have been recommended to me by friends and family members, and I have not been impressed. I have been consistantly wowed not only by Kelly's cupcakes, but also by her service.  Delivery is always as promised and on time, even on weekends!\n\nFollow her on twitter @butterandme"
"1","Worst experience with any company I have ever dealt with. Nothing was completed when promised. Final deadline was missed. No estimates provided for any work. You have no idea what your budget is and when you ask you are not given any helpful information other than to go to the store and pick out like for like items. If you don't remember or know brands you are not provided any guidance. Regardless of whether you follow insurance allowances you will always be told you are over budget and need to pay out of pocket. Don't feel pressured to use this company, take your time and figure out how to do it on your own."
"3","This is a cool restaurant.  I didn't explore too much of it, but it has a nice bar and the outside seating area is really pretty, with multiple levels and waterworks.  When we ate here it was a little chilly still at night, so the heat lamps were appreciated.\n\nService was a little spotty all night.  We ran dry on water a few times, and it seemed like it took forever for our food to come out.  We had some chips and salsa (mediocre, unfortunately, and not free, doubly unfortunately) to tide us over, but things were definitely not moving quickly.\n\nThe main courses, though, were good.  I had the stacked enchiladas, which were so big and different they barely registered as enchiladas.  They had good spice to them, though, and I liked being able to have two different meats going on.  The fried egg was a bit unnecessary, though.  I was hoping for a runny yolk, because I love me some runny yolks, but it didn't have one, and thus didn't add much.\n\nTanya enjoyed her Tesuque chicken salad.  It did have a surprising amount of spice to it between the veggies and the tasty dressing.  The jalapeno bacon was good, too, but the tortilla crusted chicken was more crust than chicken, which was a bit disappointing.\n\nOur companions had lobster enchiladas, which seemed to be the biggest hit of the night, and crab stuffed poblanos, which were also popular.  I didn't get to try those, so that's just hearsay, but they appear to be safe bets.\n\nOverall, things were mostly good, but there were some little issues that held it back from being a great meal.  I would definitely come back, though."
"1","I had had two drinks and the slot lady cut me off! I had two drinks after 5 hours, the security guard found nothing wrong with me and the cocktail waitress told me I was only able to drink water!!! This place is cheap as heck and found every reason to nickel and dime me through out our stay. STAY AWAY!!!!!"
"4","Awesome old-school style & good food. Usually busy, but the wait isn't generally long. Great staff and you can expect to pay from about $30. to 50.00 / person, depending on what you want. The salad, bread, table wine & a cappuccino to top things off are included in the main course price. Worth the walk."
"3","4th of July... everything is packed so of course there was a wait, for a table of 12.  There really wasn't anywhere to actually wait, and even though many of us ordered from the bar, we got the distinct feeling that we were not welcome to linger while waiting for our table, so we were in the way of the wait staff no matter where we tried to cram ourselves.  \n\nThe food was good though.  I had a buffalo chicken wrap and it was good.  However, someone at our table was charged for extra ketchup... what is that about?!  Glad I didn't ask for extra buffalo sauce as usual.  \n\nDespite these issues, we were served in a timely fashion and the food was better than I expected because of the reviews.  It is pricier than it should be for the quality but still better than I expected."
"1","READ THIS REVIEW BEFORE GETTING YOUR MARRIAGE LICENSE\n\nAmong those who's promoting their \""wedding chapel\"", they will promise you to give you wedding service at chapel with low cost. THIS IS A BIG FAT LIE! \na guy outside of marriage bureau offered us to give wedding ceremony at $45 at the chapel and told us the wedding is free if they charge a penny more. Israel even offered a limo back to our hotel after ceremony. They gave me a ride to the chapel and disappeared soon as i got off the car.\nso.. this is where fun story begins. you had to pay extra $65 on top of $45 to perform ceremony in the chapel. Limo? yeah right, they dropped us off at taxi stand.\n\nA Special Memory Wedding Chapel will CHEAT and LIE to you on your very special moment to get your business."

Figurez-vous donc que c'est tellement petit comme place, qu'en rentrant vous savez que c'est bel et bien l'in-time (Car il peut y avoir des rapprochements). Je suis devenu bon ami de coude avec mon voisin de chaise. \nEnvion 26 places assise max! donc c'est sur r\u00e9servation seulement. Le tout est divis\u00e9 en 2 services, un a 17h00 et l'autre \u00e0 21h00.\nBravo pour le service. la proprio et la serveuse connaissaient leur menu par coeur de long en large, ce que j'admire toujours. Notre serveuse Vanessa c'est assur\u00e9 qu'on manque de rien.\nJ'ai manger une salade c\u00e9sar en entr\u00e9e - une salade ordinaire, mais c'est vraiment pas une entr\u00e9e, c'est presqu'un repas. La plupart des gens autour de la table (nous \u00e9tions 14) ont pris les escargots gratin\u00e9s au go\u00fbt du jour et tous semblaient unanimement content de leur plat.\nComme repas c'est suivi des fettuccini \u00e0 la sauce GiGi que j'ai bien aim\u00e9. (je suis du type sauce et j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 servi)\nLes prix sont abordable et les portions quand m\u00eame grosses (Vous risquez d'avoir un lunch pour le lendemain)\nIl font aussi des combos moules-p\u00e2tes qui avaient l'air tr\u00e8s bon\nLa proprio m'a fait mention qu'habituellement si vous \u00eates juste 2, vous risquez de manger quand m\u00eame, mais que c'est un risque \u00e0 prendre.\nLe gros plus est que c'est un emportez votre vin-bi\u00e8re.\nUn n\u00e9gatif pour moi est qu'il ne prenne uniquement que l'argent comptant!\nUne belle d\u00e9couverte pour ma part j'y retournerai c'est sur....Peut-\u00eatre que je pourrai payer avec mes rouleaux de cennes noires qui me reste!"
"4","Nice, weird space inside with bright accents of color. Friendly service and delicious cookies. The iced cafe au lait was a bit bitter tasting, but still better than other cafes (looking at you Second Cup), especially the nearby Starbucks. It can be a little cramped inside and the barista misunderstood us and made 2 drinks when I asked for 2% milk."
"5","A visit to this Apple Store will help you. Quickly, efficiently and in a pleasant manner. Like other Apple retail stores the design is pleasant. The employees here are what really make the visit welcoming.\n\nI'm a repeat customer. \nI don't really know why I try to shop anywhere else for tech stuff. Other than being lazy and marginally closer to other stores.\n\nToday, for example I was in pursuit of a thing-a-ma-gig to hold my iPhone. Someone had given me a product name. And of course I had instantly forgotten it and neglected to jot the intel down in my iPhone. \n\n(I used a pen. ON PAPER.)\n\nWhile visited a mega-store I explained my product needs: Something to hold my smartphone while I took photos. I needed the function of a tripod without the bulk. The portability to carry something small and for this item to be pliable. (For it to wrap around fence posts and trees. Taking selfies is darn hard. You have no idea.)\n\nLost and confused with a failed interaction at that nameless giant store I rang this Apple. One voice input into their system and I was speaking to a rep. ONE. Same story shared there. I thought I had a product name. They found two options for me - in stock - started to explain the difference when I said, \""Hang on. I'm coming!\""\n\nZipped over. Walked in and was immediately grabbed by a friendly employee. \""Yes, thank you. I'm looking at these items. I already made a choice. But.....I have a random other need.\""\n\nThe dude - and I feel awful writing this review - I never have time to grab names here - found another dude. BAM. Super dude explained some available options.\n\nWhere will I be coming to spend more time? (And likely my money?)\n\nThis Apple store.\n\nCustomer service matters. They've got it down."
"4","Just got back from trying the lunch buffet at Taste of India, which was pretty good and a definite value.  It is $7.95/person and includes a drink - soda, mango juice or mango lassi.  The buffet has the usual chutneys and raitas, naan, vegetable pakoras, fresh fruit (mostly watermelon), salad, chicken fried rice and plain basmati rice, 3 chicken dishes and 3 veggie dishes.  Today there was tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala and a plain old chicken curry, channa masala, alu palak, and alu green beans.  There were also gulab jamuns.\n\nMy favorite was definitely the alu green beans, which disappointingly is not on the menu.  The chickpeas were good, but I thought the alu palak was disappointing.  (I am generally disappointed in palak paneer at restaurants since I have an awesome recipe that I make at home all the time.)  The watermelon chunks were an awesome palate cleanser, and the gulab jamuns were great.  Total for two people came to $17 before tip.\n\nThis is a nice little place, and at lunch almost everyone there is Children's Hospital staff.  Parking is a little hard to find since the residential streets are permit only.  But I really like this place and it's definitely worth it."
"3","Qdoba is ok. Same idea as Chipotle Grill, but, in my opinion, the food just doesn't taste as good. The burritos don't have that magic ingredient that makes me want to return. And I did not dig the decorating scheme - especially the concrete floors and metal tables. It feels cold and dark, even in the summer."
"5","Well tonight I will be going to bed early.  Thanks to the unbelievable dinner I had last night at Basil 'N Lime.  I woke up at the crack of dawn to the reminder of the delicious leftovers that were calling to me from my refrigerator.  This quaint establishment is enormous in flavor.  The fresh vegetables were saut\u00e9ed yet crisp, the meat was as tender as eating cotton candy.  Starting out with the eclectic plate of appetizers was a trip to heaven.  The spice rating is a scale from 1-5.  I always treat my spice ratio as if I'm putting together an outfit.  In the words of the famous fashion designer Coco Channel...it is easier to add than take away.  The entrees were ordered as a  three.  The delectable flavor of the food was not hidden in the heat.  I can't wait to go back and enjoy more of their tempting choices.  The restaurant does not serve alcohol.  Which is a blessing in disguise.  You would not want any of your senses denied the aroma, taste and presentation of this restaurant.  I highly recommend the Thai Iced Tea.   To top it all off, I can sleep sounding because I know that their Garlic Beef is only a phone call away because they do deliver.  My hat's off to you, Chef Moo and your staff."
"5","Always wanted to try a Food Network chef's restaurant, so this was our chance. My husband, me and our 3 yr old daughter had a great experience there. The food was delicious. My husband had the Crunchburger, he ate up his burger in 5 minutes! I had the L.A. Bunless Burger. The burger without the bun in a mix of greens. We shared the fries and sweet potato fries. Best sweet potato fries I have had in awhile. It came with honey mustard and chipotle cream sauce. The decor is causal, loved the design of the eating bar. Definitely will go back!"
"4","This place had me hypnotized. There are 30 restaurants in the Venetian and I had my first 3 meals here. I'm not a Chinese food or noodle freak. I just really liked the food, either that or they got me hooked on MSG or something. Whatever I was, I couldn't take my palette off them for 2 days and I will be searching for food of similar quality back in Philly. I've decided to check Chinatown since I think it's likely there are a few Chinese restaurants there."
"3","Pros:comfortable bed, Great price 31per night, location, high energy casino, free parking. \n\nCons: dirty bathroom with leaking faucet, rooms on Fremont side very loud. AC is loud, our room was basic with no chair to sit in."
"1","Huge disappointment!\n\nI came here with my parents (Jan 2011) as I was craving some Asian food, and this place sounded like they had some great noodles. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. The price was high the service was below average, the wait was long, and the food was just okay.\n\nI was hoping for some good Chinese Green Tea as is complimentary at most Chinese Restaurants, however they charged by the person, so I skipped that.\n\nWhat we ordered: \n\nSingapore Style Rice Noodles ($16.99): The menu had no description, so my family assumed it would be vegetarian. When these noodles came out, they had pork and shrimp. We don't eat pork, so we told our server that we couldn't eat the noodles. He started blaming us for ordering the food, and disappointment sank in. We asked if there was anything that could be done, and he said that he would ask them to make it with just shrimp. We waited for at least 10-15 minutes nibbling on the 'Crispy Chicken' and getting more frustrated as others were being attended to nicely. When the food finally arrived, there was no meat and no flavor. A complete waste of money.\n\nBraised Beef Brisket and Tendon \nNoodle Soup ($16.99): The best dish we ordered. Tasted like a beef stew with noodles. Not amazing, but not bad. The beef was nicely cooked and the noodles were pretty good too.\n\nHar Gow, Shrimp Dumplings (4) ($10.99): The dumpling wrapper was too thick in my opinion and it broke easily, holding a small piece of shrimp. Nothing special.\n\nCrispy Chicken in Szechuan Garlic Sauce ($19.99): A small plate of 'crispy chicken' (dry chicken, very thin pieces), with 'garlic sauce' on the side. This was pretty much like Chicken Katsu, and I was not impressed with the Szechuan garlic sauce. Not worth it at all.\n\nAt the end, I was hoping to order a boba drink to go, but our server came by with our check before asking if we wanted any desserts or anything else, so I told my parents not to mention it."
"4","Being an Asheville native, Zada Jane's feels familiar. Sunny Point, Early Girls, Over Easy; they all came to mind the first time I walked in. It wasn't until I had a pleasant conversation with a Zada Jane's founder that I learned this feeling is not a coincidence, or blind admiration, but instead a calculated effort. \""I love Asheville\"" he said. \""I lived there for many years and miss going to places like Sunny Point. Charlotte needs more places like that.\"" I couldn't agree more. \n\nThe food has been above average the half-dozen meals I've had at Zada's, though somewhat inconsistent. It seems the later it is, with fewer people inside, the better the food tastes. You certainly won't find a better eggs dish any where in town at 9:45pm on a weeknight.   \n\nIf located in downtown Asheville, Zada's may be viewed in a different light. It's out matched by Sunny Point and Over Easy. But in the Queen City, Zada's it's in a class of it's own."
"1","This was my second time going to JET. The first time was fun. Maybe because it was a GQ private party before they opened it to the public. It was open bar and they had a band before the DJ came. This time . . . was AWFUL!!! Those things behind the bars are the rudest people I've met. The night that we went, they were doing a promotion for Skyy vodka, so ladies drank free (with coupons) skyy drinks until midnight. I asked the first bartender what type of drinks I could get. She said \""any\"" Skyy vodka drink. I then asked for a cosmo. She took my drink coupon and then rudely said, \""You can't have that.\"" I told her that you just told me that I could have \""any\"" Skyy vodka drink.She said, \""Not that\"". I ended up getting a vodka & cranberry because she was sooooo rude, I wanted to yell at her. Then my date ordered his drink. He asked her something about brown liquors. She yelled at him, \""This is a full bar! We have everything here! What do you want?! We ended up walking away because we both wanted to curse her little scrawny butt out at that point. \n\nThe next bar wasn't any better. It seemed that the drink coupons were like the \""kiss of death\"". Once the girls saw them, the attitudes came. It was like since you are not paying for the drink, you don't deserve good service. Plus they were NOT even serving us Skyy vodka! They were using the house brand. They poured it from the spout and I know that Skyy was NOT the house brand. After 4 watered down drinks and no buzz, I BOUGHT a martini with Skyy vodka. BIG DIFFERENCE! I actually saw her pick up a skyy bottle to make the drink. I know that the free drinks weren't going to be the best, but I didn't expect the rudeness. I am never going back to JET. The service was extremely poor. Those bartenders were the worst! They should all be fired."
"5","I stayed, gambled, and partied at Encore during the Halloween weekend. I must say, this is the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Granted, I've never stayed at a 5-star hotel before, but I feel you cannot ask for more. \n\nGambling: The roulette table was so much fun. My friend Jose spilled his drink on the table and nobody even yelled at him or made him feel bad. They just cleaned it up and joked about it. So cool. Also, as a first time customer, they gave me and my friend Carlo $20 to play the slot machines. We ended up winning over $100 collectively from that.\n\nPool: European. Nuff said.\n\nRoom: OMG. So nice. My phone had my name on the LCD. The room had a doorbell. Next to my bed was a control panel that could close or open the curtains! Swivel flat screen TV. Floor to ceiling windows. Tub and shower. Dual sinks. Amazing concierge service.\n\nNightclub: XS and Surrender are both at Encore. Surrender was awesome, but XS, I cannot explain how nice this nightclub is. You have to go to find out. It was expensive ($50 cover and $500 bottles), but hey, it's Vegas. It's expected.\n\nFood: Ate at the Wynn buffet. Incredible. Although I prefer hot crab legs over cold ones. It was fresh nonetheless."
"3","Service can be a bit slow at times. Also, I rarely see the place crowded. Still, its a good place to eat. Usually people go for the daily specials, where they give you a big plate with their house salad (delicious), a daily-changing entree, rice and some bread. It's about 10 dollars. They usually have 2 vegetarian and 2 non-vegetarian daily options. I love their limeade (its terrifically bright and fresh, made from real limes). Also, if you happen to be really rich (which I'm not) you might fancy buying some of the Peruvian art they sell in the store. Try touching the pelts on your way out, probably the softest fur you've ever felt in your life. Also, they have fun finger dolls, knit to look like naked people. The nudists sell for about 3 bucks a pop though..."
"1","I am incredibly surprised this place has a 4 star rating. I recently moved to the area and drive by here quite a bit so after checking yelp decided to give it a try on a random week night. It was pretty dead and the waitress was nice enough but completely forgot our appetizer, which we had to ask to have removed from our bill (we figured we wouldn't bother with it since we had already been served our entrees). I got the Singapore noodles with chicken and was incredibly disappointed. It was disgustingly salty, even after drenching it in Siracha I still couldn't eat it. My fiance got the Teppanyaki beef and yakisoba which was not in fact yakisoba (yea, I know the difference). Not every Asian noodle is the same people! He could at least stomach his meal. I ended up grabbing something at Fry's on our way home so I wouldn't go hungry for the evening."
"5","Excellent pricing for quality.\n\nThe corner cabinet met my need and purpose as I am an anti-MDF person.\n\nAs I browsed the Etsy catalog, I fell in love with the gold mirror -- the right size and design.\n\nFurnitures were super duper clean and ready to use.\n\nIt took me a month to get the furnitures as I had a few mishap with shipping vendors.  Jonathan was very helpful, patient and accommodating.  Thank you!  Easy and clear communication via text and email.\n\nI hope to get more pieces from JKL as I start to fill the space of my small apartment."
"5","I've been to this twice already and realized I had not written a review for this amazing place. \nLet's start off with service - excellent! They were very attentive and friendly. The staff treats you like you've known them forever. Next ... Parking is never a problem because they have tons right in front of their restaurant. \nThe place is cozy and gets packed so fast so calling in for reservations was a great idea. I brought my cousins and aunt visiting San Diego and they enjoyed the food so much. \nWhat free Ngo-Yong for every Yelp check-in? Of course we took advantage of that. I loved the sauce that accompanied this. Ngo-Yong is very different from all the egg rolls that people are used to ordering. It's an acquired taste but its something that grows on you right away. \nWe ordered the Sinigang, Kare-Kare and of course, Lechon. The sinigang had great flavor. I'm very picky when it comes to ordering sinigang from Filipino restaurants because most of the time, they under-season it with tamarind. Cafe De Cebu isn't afraid of seasoning their food and they have it right. The pork that they used for their sinigang is also lechon pork! I'm in pork heaven. Even if all we ordered was pork, it wasn't too oily. \nThe lechon was so tender yet the skin was crunchy. I liked using their vinegar sauce instead of the usual lechon sauce. It provided a different taste to it and balanced out the flavor. I could smell the lemongrass that was stuffed into the belly, it was a good aroma that elevated the taste of the lechon. I had the lechon the first visit and we ordered it again the second time we came. \n\u00dcbe cheesecake for dessert, need I say more? I will definitely be back. I saw a recent post that they've also introduced Sisig. I'm sure it's as flavorful as the other dishes I've had here."
"4","So I still haven't sat down in the restaurant for dinner, but I love the bar.\nIt's located in the old, janky (but refurbed!) Royal Hotel (self-styled \""Royal Resort\""!), so I give it plus points for that. The Royal is in kinda a random location, but it's close enough to head to the strip after or just home if you're old and have kids, like me.\nThe main reason I love the Barrymore bar is because I feel so cool drinking there and bringing guests to drink there. It's like you know about a secret hipster hangout....fancy hipsters, not PBR-swilling types!\nThe d\u00e9cor is awesome, in a golden age of Hollywood kinda way, and the drinks are delicious. Cocktails are also pretty reasonably priced, considering the near-strip location and the fancy menu at the restaurant."
"3","Tall soy chai tasted like any other one that I have had at Starbucks. The BFs drip coffee did not taste like it had been there for a decade.... and they had a mug his mom wanted (she collects Starbucks mugs)."
"4","We liked this place for the food and that it is convenient to our house. YAY! Very small place that looks more like a take out joint than a sit down restaurant although there are seating available. We were expecting a restaurant and when we saw how small the place it was we were afraid the food would not be good as in restaurant quality Boy were we wrong! And glad it is what it is as I look forward to coming back and getting wraps to go if I am in a bind. I had the gyro wrap. My son had the falafel wrap. He also wanted hummus and lucky for him it was part of the falafel wrap. My husband had an entree which included  tabbouleh, stuffed grape leaves and baba ganoush. Everything was delicious and authentic. Hey, I am not Mediterrean but grew up in NY. I had my share of ethnic cuisine to say that Jerusalem Cafe is the real deal. We also had pistachio baklava after our meal. Excellent as well."
"4","The Penang is out of the world. Jungle curry was really good. Pad Thai was just ok."
"5","This is an easy 5 stars. Amazing decor and atmosphere. Great selection and perfectly done steaks. My favorite is the rib eye bone in."
"1","There was basically no cheese on my \""cheese combo sandwich\"", the fries were gross, and the waitress was nasty to us."
"3","Its a cool place but as far as mini golf goes i found it too easy and cramped. It was worth visiting....but i probably wont be coming back."
"1","If they charge $11 for a tiny glass of friggin' Cadillac they'd better make it right. Boy, this place sucks. That is why I live in LA!"
"1","I wish I had read the yelp reviews before going to Chayo!!\nThis place is bad!!!\nOverpriced... don't get me wrong, I will spend $$ for good food!! I don't want to be charged for bad food, and really bad food at that!!\nService is terrible... slow... rude... a little condescending even.\nWe started with the guacamole with pork rinds... the smallest portion of guacamole I have ever been served.\nWe also had the lobster tacos as an appetizer..... bad.. dry... no flavor at all!!!!\nI was hesitant after that to even order an entr\u00e9e. (yes the waiter hadn't came to take or order for our entree, until we had completely finished our appetizers)\nWe decided to share the steak fajitas..... big mistake... big... huge... \nDon't do it... go somewhere else"
"3","This seems to be a sweet small pub in the heart of Marchmont, but unfortunately is really too small for anything. There is a good selection of  beer and the staff are friendly but you can't escape the feeling that everyone else can hear everything you are saying. In summer it is a bit better, as they have a few seats outside, but due to the nature of the pavement, there is not a lot of space for many. \nThe biggest disappointment is that they have a downstairs area that would add considerable space to the pub if it were used, and didn't remain constantly with the lights off. However they do show all the big football games, and as there are few pubs in Marchmont to choose from, this is a good bonus."
"2","Ohhh I wanted to like it! We live in Henderson, so it took a lot to convince my roommate to drive the 30 miles one way -- I had to offer to pay LOL so off we went. I ordered NY Street Dog, waffle fries & BBQ Western Burger w/bacon. I have to admit when the food got to the table, in the cute little bar style baskets -- I turned to my roommate and said \""disgusting\"". It was so gross, to me (and I'm from the west coast) but it was all Chicago style -- like a mess. It wasn't the type of food you can just pick up and eat, the bun - from both the hot dog and the burger were just saturated, wet, soggy, mushy like dough like gross - which is where my \""disgusting\"" game from. So the hotdog was some type of pressed meat type of hot-dog, like a cheap hot dog and it was not grilled. It was not a good, high quality hot dog at all. What I didn't like was it was all pink - inside and out I don't know I like my hotdogs grilled with like grill marks on the outside. This dog sat down in the soggy bun covered with sour croute and mustard. I bit off the one end and pushed the hotdog over to my roommate. He cut his burger in half and gave me half - same thing, and I wanted to take a picture but I felt silly - it was a big piece of mush. Seriously like \u00be of it had been dipped in BBQ sauce........... It seems like the BBQ burger had some kind chili on it or something but it was all over saturated with BBQ/Chili sauce. I took a bite, the burger itself seemed like a good burger - and I did like the actual meat of the burger itself but as the BBQ sauce got all over my hands and fingers it was a mess, yucky - I set the rest of the burger in its basket and pushed it away. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands. Oh ya and they were out of waffle fries - so we opted for the \""natural\"" fries, which ya, were very greasy. We ate all of the fries, because we were hungry and both of us not too happy with the meals - the little sauces that came with the fries was good  some kind of Cajun sauce and what seemed to be tarter.\n\nLike I said I wanted to like this place, I like the d\u00e9cor and the waitress was very nice but this place is not my style. I'll continue on my personal search for a great Las Vegas burger."
"4","I absolutely love Cosmo.  Not only are the new restaurants pretty darn good, but it's visually stunning.  I love the lobby area from the main entrance, where the columns are large screens.  Not to be vulgar, but it's a visual mindf&^k.  Don't come here stoned.  Trust me.\n\nAnyway, great restaurants, great discounts and rewards with their casino card (free), so grab one.  If you give your name and number they'll give you $10 to play on the slots.\n\nYou cannot go wrong with a sparkly, shiny, hip hotel like the Cosmo."
"4","My mother in law was in for a visit and we were in the mood for soup and salad. I had been wanting to try Caf\u00e9 Zupas and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. As we walked in, the young lady at the front door explained the menu and offerings - this was very helpful seeing it was our first visit. It was busy, but the staff at the counter took the time to explain things and let us taste a few of the soups, which was very helpful. \n\nI had the chicken enchilada chili and the BBQ chicken salad. Both were great. My mother in law loved her food as well. The meal also came with a chocolate covered strawberry. It actually was a lot of food.  The only bland part of the meal was the bread that came with the soup - it was nothing special. \n\nThe dining room was very nice and the attendant in the room was a really sweet, helpful lady.\n\nI'll definitely plan on returning in the future."
"2","Apparently the D is for disappointment. The td;dr version: room had broken shower, management lied about room switching, but ended up switching it after in person exchange.\n\nTempted to give this a 1-star but an arduous room switch process bumped it up to a 2. Here is what happened: we reserved a room at the D because a friend of mine was having her 30th birthday celebration on Fremont street & she picked the D as the suggestion for hotel.\n\nCheck in process was pretty smooth. The room looked clean albeit a bit noisy as it faces the Fremont street (no problem with that - can sleep with ambient noises). However, in the next morning, we realized the shower doesn't have a handle to channel the water from tub to overhead. Called front desk and they said they'd send over an engineer. 45 minutes go by - nobody shows up. By now we need to get going so we meet up with the group for brunch. I called again and a different person picks up, promised would send engineering over. \n\nI said we're strapped on time, and asked a room switch was possible. The answer was no; the only available ones for switching were smoking rooms. Nope, not acceptable. I said if I could get the keys to one of the smoking rooms so we can just use the shower. After back and forth with the receptionist, she said to come down and talk with her manager. So I did ... and after explaining the situation and asking about getting keys to a smoking room temporarily, all of a sudden a non-smoking room was available after all. Ha ha, what? \n\nOne: don't assign rooms with non-functioning shower to your guests. Two: don't lie to them about room availability."
"3","this review may be a bit underrated as i was only at the mercat to attend an event.  so due to this, perhaps didn't experience the full of extent of what the bar has to offer.  but that said, the drink selection is pretty decent (although my boyfriend was disappointed that he could only get prosseco and not champange, but i think this is normal for most mid-range bars and probably a request they very infrequently get).  however, there was a large number of spirits available and beers on tap or bottled.  so no one went thirsty.  i noticed that some people had ordered food and it smelled good, but i can't report on the quality as i didn't have any.\n\ni have to say that the service though was excellent.  there was a large number of people, some very drunk, constantly at the bar ordering more drinks.  but the bartenders were polite (although they did look a wee bit harassed, which i dont' blame them for) and did their best to keep up with the demand for drinks.  \n\nso i did find this place A-OK and i'm sure on a return visit i'll be happy to update my review and perhaps add another star.  but in terms of use for a mid-size event, this was a good venue.  they booked out the lower bar for us which was a great space and had it's own private bar so no need to travel upstairs.  my only real complaint was the spiral staircase between the floors.  i mean a few drinks and wearing heels meant that i had great difficulty in not falling on my face when i attempted to go up or downstairs.  perhaps they should re-think this design in terms of customer health and safety!"
"2","At least the atmosphere is fun, because the food stinks!  The only reason I'm giving two stars is the delicious iced green tea.  I ordered a pasta with lemon butter, artichokes, spinach, broccoli, and fresh garlic, but as far as I could tell, the lemon butter was supposed to make up for the lack of vegetables.  Please give me more than six leaves of spinach and five small broccolis for a whole plate of pasta!  Norm P.'s food was even worse.  It was swimming in sauce to the point of being disgusting and he couldn't even finish it.  All in all, come for the drinks but not for the food.  I could make this same meal at home for less than a dollar, and it would taste much better."
"2","I'm only giving this 2 stars instead of 1 because of the way Jim handled our problem. This review is mainly based on service and not food. \n\nMy boyfriend and I were told to go to the shiloh grill from a friend. We got here and it was a 45 minute wait, which is fine so we waited. After 45 minutes we were seated by the hostess. Our server never, NEVER asked us what we wanted to drink. Not once throughout our whole meal. He told us there would be a girl following him for training and that was all he said. We told him we'd like an appetizer and told him which one. He said they were all out. We picked another one, he said they were out of that too. We picked a third appetizer - surprise! Out of that too. We asked him what they weren't out of and he said their Hush Piggies so we ordered that as we were starving and wanted an appetizer. 35 minutes later, still no appetizer. A woman (the manager at the time, though she never said she was or even said her name) came up to us laughing and said \""your order was the last order we had and it got burnt so we can't give it to you, but we'll take it off the bill\"" -obviously you will take it off. She asked if we wanted anything else and we asked when our food would be out (why order an app if it's been 35 minutes and the food should be out shortly?) she said it would be out momentarily. We said we'd pass on the appetizers so she walked away. A few minutes later our waiter came to say he'd pushed our food to the front so it would be out next. No. Another 35 minutes for our meal, so we were obviously mad we didn't order another app. Nonetheless, I ordered a turkey burger and he ordered a mushroom burger. Definitely nothing that should take an hour. At this point we had yet to complain once but i'm sure our annoyance was obvious. I wanted to speak with the manager but she was in the bar on her cellphone talking to two guys for 20 minutes as we could see into the bar. We waited for our bill but it never came for 15 minutes when Jim talked to us. Jim is the entire reason I didn't give the place one star. He should be running the place, really. He was awesome. He came up to us (meanwhile he had just walked in and wasn't even there during our whole ordeal!). He told us our whole meal was being comp'd, apologized immensely, and told us to order dessert. We did, the dessert was good but pretty sure it was nuked as it was cold in many spots and warm in others. We didn't complain because at this point, oh well. He then came back after we had finished our desert and Jim came up to us giving us the owner's business card and a $20 gift certificate to come back again. We both decided we will never come back for a meal (the food was decent, but not worth all this trouble) but would come back and spend it at the bar. It's a shame that the service gave them this review, but if it wasn't for JIm they'd only have 1 star. If the owner or management reads this, Jim needs a raise and the girl manager who was working on 4/16 needs a demotion and her cell phone should be put away during a shift. So unprofessional."
"5","This is the best place to get maxi dresses. It might be pricier than other places, but the quality and fit are way superior. I have invested in 1 dress each summer and they are by far my favorite dresses and I get a ton of compliments when I wear them. I don't see other girls wearing the same ones either."
"1","Things got worse after we checked in\n There were 2 service people standing with nothing to do but they said we had to see Joe. Well Joe was on a lengthy phone conversation so we waited 20 mins. for him to check us in. Made no sense to make an appt. There is absolutely no reason to do things this way. All I can think is these guys are on commission.:'( When I made the appt. I told them I would have to wait and gave them all of our information. Joe made us go over it all again. Name, phone #, address,  email address. He also asked if we could leave the car over the weekend. Frustrating to say the least. Can only imagine how long this is going to take. Just bad customer service. Won't go back."
"3","You can't go wrong with a Club Lulu w/ cheese - that's been at five stars in my book since I first discovered Jimmy Johns in college (Columbia, MO).\n\nThis review is specific to the experience I had at this Las Vegas location.\n\nI called for delivery, but was shot down by a rude female who said my location was out of their one-mile radius delivery range even though the borderline intersection she mentioned was outside the apartment I was visiting. Despite trying to explain this to her, she would not back down and so I didn't place an order.\n\nGoing over the options of what to do (e.g. walk or drive), I decided to call back one last time. As I hoped, a different worker answered the phone. Although he did mention that my intersection was the furthest they go for delivery, he heard me out and placed my order. It's because of that fine human being that I got my Club Lulu w/ cheese delivered."
"3","Food was okay, my rice was good but my flautas were super greasy and not very flavorful... The best thing about the experience was probably the bean dip and chips. But I've still had better"
"2","Service could not have been worse. Totally rude waitress, ridiculously long wait for food and our bill. \n\nThe food was not bad though, and the location inside the hotel and atmosphere were cool, so a few stars for that!"
"4","Outstanding Chinese in the wasteland of central Illinois. Get the salt and pepper chicken. This place appears to be hardcore, no whities while I dined. The menu has a special section only in Chinese. Strange sign on the wall says: Please clean your table for the next customer."
"1","This is where poor lambs go to get slaughtered. I should have brought my gun with me in here 8 yrs ago when they did not want to give me back my keys after I test drove their camry. I was a young pup back then but stupid me for bringing in a blank check. They passed me up their hierarchy of sales lowlifes trying to close the deal. I had to rip the blank check in their faces so they would give me back my keys. If you have a concealed weapons permit and a handgun, proudly wear it in this fine establishment."
"4","thai food is probably my favorite asian cuisine of all time and i can eat thai food every single day. after moving to vegas from houston i've had deep cravings for some authentic thai food and my manager told me about this place on wynn rd.\n\nit's a hole in the wall place and parking is a bit strange. (i usually park at the rental offices/warehouse parking lot behind the restaurant) the restaurant is EXTREMELY small, it probably sits about fifteen people total. i've never dined in but the place is always packed when i go in for my pick up order. \n\ntom yum soup is to die for, omg i can eat this every day!\nspicy basil fried rice is super yummy, i got it with chicken.\ni also got a spicy rice noodle plate that is similar to the pad kee mao, which is usually my favorite thai noodle dish, and it was alright...could be spicier.\n\ntheir spice level ranges from 1-10 and i order a 7 for everything.\n\ntheir thai tea is probably the most amazing thai tea i have ever had, they give you a HUGE cup if you order a large. (feeds probably three people but i am a fatass)\n\nto sum up, this has probably become my go-to thai place if i've ever craving thai, (which is all the time) and i recommend this place!"
"2","Really small potato knish for $10.  Mom didn't like her vegan either.  \n\nWater (tap, not bottled) tasted reality funny.  I felt my whole mouth covered with grit or sand.  Made me wonder about the ice.  I doubt they used Fiji water to make the ice :)  \n\nWon't come back here I suggest you don't either.   Not good quality or  a good deal.\n\nStaff was grumpy too :P\n\nI suggest you try somewhere else.  This place is REALLY bad."
"2","We went to Our Families Country Cafe with a Groupon, and I have to say that it was just below OK.  We ordered fried chicken, and the portions were generous, but the chicken was pretty tasteless.  The mashed potatoes were called \""real,\"" but I don't believe it.  And the canned green beans were horrible.  The bread was good.  The worst was the \""homemade clam chowder.\""  Really??  My guess is that Smart and Final sells a cream base to which was added some canned clams.  That is not homemade.  I cook better and use fresher ingredients than this supposed \""country\"" restaurant.  Did love the little boy who refilled our iced tea.  All around service was great."
"5","I've been a frequent patron of the Great Dane for over a decade, and there is good reason.  First, the beer is brewed on location and they have an amazing menu.  Add in the fun ambience and accommodating wait staff and you have a great restaurant.  \n\nIf you're in Madison long enough, you'll hear people mention Crop Circle Wheat more than a few times.  It's the best beer the Dane brews.  All the other beers are good too.  You can do a beer sampler if you want to find some other favorites. \n\nThere aren't many places that can say they have awesome meatloaf, ravioli, nachos and burgers.  Somehow, the Dane can straddle all of these different flavors and do them extremely well.  That's part of why I have come here so often; no matter what the people in your group want, they can get it here.\n\nYou can have many different types of experiences at the Dane based on where you are seated.  The front bar area is super fun and chill if you want to shoot pool, darts, play the jukebox or just watch sports.  The dining area on the top floor is casual and great for groups.  In the basement, you take your own tour of the Dane brewing process, which is fun in itself.  Eating dinner in the basement is more intimate, as its a bit darker with the stone walls.  The best place to eat though is the back beer patio.  On a sunny day or a cool night, its a fun experience that makes the Dane feel like a fancy restaurant without having to pay for it.\n\nStaff is awesome.  Just tell them what you want, they'll help you out.  We used to rent out the Dane for large group events, and they were always helpful.  \n\nThe Great Dane is an essential Madison experience."
"2","Man, I was really excited to eat here. The good reviews, the fresh tacos....I came on a Tuesday at 2pm for lunch and there was no line. This was the week before Memorial so they can't blame the lack of quality on a holiday rush. The place is pretty inside but the buffet is spread out all along the wall of the room that it made going back for stuff a long walk. (I'm not lazy, I was traveling with older folk) Anyway, the food seemed like it had been sitting out for awhile and nothing was that spectacular. It all tasted like typical buffet food. I had no idea why they gave us these rubber pot holders as nothing I got was hot. The tortillas weren't made fresh and I was looking to having the meat carved from the spit. Nope. I tried the fresh watermelon juice, yuck. The best thing was the fresh dessert crepes.  Our plate waiter was kind of rude too. Save your money, skip the buffet,  and just go to a restaurant."
"4","I went today for lunch. They have an all you can eat Lunch Special, for $9.97 you can graze their very nice salad and seafood bar plus a 4 dish hot section. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised, everything was really fresh and all the things I tried were Delicious. \n\nSome of the things I ate were, Tilapia with pineapple sauce, Potato Lasagna it was kind of like scalloped potatoes very thinly sliced with cheese in between, really tasty. Shrimp ceviche, roasted eggplant salad, fresh blanched broccoli salad, roasted zucchini salad, chicken salad, marinated mushrooms and some other things that are slipping my mind at the moment. \n\nSorry No pics this time, it would have been an awkward moment to whip out the camera in this setting being I was all by myself.  Hopefully next time I wont have to go alone ;-)\n\nI would surely go back for lunch again and maybe even dinner. Even though I'm not really a meat eater, there was plenty of vegetarian options to fill me up."
"2","I was disappointed. The ratings and reviews on Yelp raised my expectations for this place. If you're a local I can see the appeal. Great wait staff, personalized service, and the chef even mingled with the crowd. BUT if you're in town on business save yourself a trip. This place is just OK. I had the short ribs, which by the way some on Yelp raved about. Where I come from they'd call it pot roast. The calamari and shrimp appetizers were just average."
"1","Dim sum food came out cold.. Service is poor.. No detail on check out bill..I will not come here at all ..."
"1","Two words.  Dirty and nasty. Better off driving 3 miles to the Steele creek McDonalds!"
"3","Im glad I didnt have high expectations based on the 4 star average rating. I ordered the Double California Steak Burger Combo. It came with shoestring fries and a drink. The burger itself was not as big as I thought since there were two patties. It's about the same size as an In n Out Double Double, only In n Out's has a little more veggies. The patties themselves were a bit salty and just a tad overcooked. The fries were your average shoe string. The Freddy's sauce and special seasoning is what probably allowed me to finish the fries.\n\nWhat is making me give them 3 stars instead of 2 is the dessert they are known for! Frozen Custard! From their menu you can have it either as a Sundae or Concrete (milkshake form). I ordered the PBC n B Sundae. Comes in mini, medium, or large. Im glad I got the mini cuz I could not finish it! The PBC n B consists of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, Sliced Bananas, Frozen Vanilla Custard, Whipped Cream, and a single Cherry on top. (refer to my pic!) They have other tantalizing flavors as well which is probably the only saving grace in coming back here.\n\nService is friendly as evidenced by the smiles and attention I received at the counter. Prices average about 7 to 8 bucks if you want a decent meal to fill you up. The overall size of the place is very spacious with enough tables and booths. The bathrooms are a nice size and is actually pretty clean.\n\nOverall, its an ok burger place. For you peeps with a sweet tooth, the desserts will always hit the spot here. If anything, make this place as your go to dessert place after having dinner somewhere else."
"2","The food at this place was quite greasy and lacking flavor. I wouldn't call this place authentic as it's just a lot of fried food with greasy yellow cheese. I do NOT recommend this for visitors looking for authentic Mexican food."
"5","What a delight!\n\nMy husband and I were in my hometown for Christmas, and ventured out on our third date since the birth of our son.  I was so excited to check out Lawrenceville for the first time, and couldn't wait to show my foodie husband that Pittsburgh can do sophisticated with the best of them.  Before dinner, we stopped at Espresso A Mano because I heard it was the best coffee shop in Pittsburgh.\n\nI was so surprised when we stepped up to the counter and the barista greeted me by my maiden name!  Thirteen years after we were on the high school track team together, Matt recognized me.  Man, he is good with names!  It was fun to catch up, and I'm so proud to see a fellow McKeesport alum being such a success.  \n\nMy decaf, almond milk latte (for my nursing son's benefit) was surprisingly rich in coffee flavor, and was served up without a hint of pretension.  I remember singing along to the music, and loved the exposed brick walls.\n\nGood people.  Good coffee."
"5","Love it!  I like that they do half sushi rolls!  The best rolls are the ocean roll, sexy roll and first kiss!  And their ice cream in your mouth is a very neat dessert roll!  Their AYCE price cannot be beat it includes Everything on their menu!"
"5","The only reason that I would go to the dealer again is if I had a warranty. Other than that there is NO reason to go anyplace else in Phoenix besides Community Tire. I plan on keeping my current vehicle until 2017 this is my second set of tires from them. Justin and Stephanie also ROCK I can call and make an appointment or to get a quote for tires and there is always a friendly voice on the other end. Last time I was in was a 7:30 appointment (I'm not a morning person) and they were so chipper. I was actually very excited to get new tires. I can stand at the counter and chat like they are my  friends on any topic from a vacation or a date or where I had dinner last night. It's also nice to grab a bottle of water and plop down in a comfy chair and log onto Wi-Fi. In addition to being a customer I have worked the two owners ( Pat and Howard) on a silent Auction for the last 4 years not only do they run a great business but they support every member of the community no matter who they are. I work for a local business and support local business that is why I LOVE community tire. Keep up the good work guys."
"3","This is me... This is me NOT on drugs... This is me saying that Guru Palace is just okay.\n\nIt's my fault though. This happens when I'm expecting way too much from a restaurant. Guru Palace has been on my list for some time now, but after they won Best of Phoenix, I had to try them immediately... so I made my way over there to enjoy a weekend lunch.\n\nThe restaurant is pretty gorgeous inside, mixing traditional art with and industrial and contemporary feel; that made me really happy. Everything was very clean and there was a lot of open space; again, I was very happy. The food was what started the decline of that happiness though. \n\nSome of the food was very good, like the Tikka Marsala - it definitely rivals India Oven's recipe and their garlic naan was excellent. But some of the food was seriously meh to me. I had some of the goat and it was extremely fatty (and I've eaten plenty of goat, I'm Middle Eastern), the mint sauce had absolutely no kick and the chicken curry (even though it had bones in it) didn't have that rich flavor that I associate with a great chicken curry. \n\nMy hope is that I missed the dishes that earned this place the Best of Phoenix award, and I look forward to eventually making it back here some day to try those dishes. *Feel free to message me you know what I should try.*"
"1","Golden Corral has better Quality food."
"1","Wow this place has very bad service.   Stopped in for a personal size pizza had 45 min before movie starts next door.  Seated no more then 20 feet from the pizza station.  After 30 min the server comes by and says they are still woking on it.  15 min latter we walked out with nothing.  This was the  only time we talked to the server and the Manager never came over, even though he could see us seating there bored to death, to explain why they are inept.  \nHad more conversation with the bus boy as he pickup around us.  Really how long does it take to bake  a 12\"" pizza 5 -8 min.\nNever again, has been 3 years since I was there before and it was so-so then, so it's not gotten better.  Fool me once good for you, fool me twice shame on me."
"4","I have eaten at this subway numerous times and enjoyed it. It is nice on convenient because it is across from the traffic chaos in desert ridge.  My favorite would be the new apple wood pork sandwich!  Really Gwooood!"
"2","Hearts topping and not even worth it. Food was surprisingly bad. I had pork and Mac grill cheese which didn't work on many levels. My son's chicken fingers were better than my dish."
"2","I've never really had a good experience with buffets. Paradise Buffet and Cafe Restaurant reminded me why I avoid them.\n\nYes, it's Vegas. Yes, they are known for world-class food and excellent buffets. Just remember that NONE of them are located in Downtown Las Vegas. \n\nThe establishment is located in the Fremont casino. It's large and maze-y with roomy booths. The decor isn't vintage; it looks like a 1980s highschool set for Wizard of Oz. There's alot of green.\n\nFirst off, our waitress didn't know what half-and-half was when we requested it with coffee. She kept pointing to the french vanilla creamer already on the table. I already had a feeling I wasn't going to like this place....\n\nThey had a decent variety of food from American hot-dogs and patties wading in gray, hot water to Italian pasta, dried out from the hot lamps to \""Chinese\"" stir-fry that could rival any MacCormack seasoning packet available at most grocery stores. I opted for jambalaya, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and beef roast from the carving station. I've never had jambalaya before (at this point) so wasn't sure what to expect; it tasted okay:lots of sausage and my friend told me it tasted like it came from a can. Can you go wrong with mashed potatoes? Yes, even Paradise can! When I attempted to add butter to the flavorless mash, I could only find margarine...Ugh, isn't anything real here? Not too surprising, after all, they didn't have half-and-half... Everything ersatz! \n\nFresh fruit and a piece of apple pie for dessert. Pretty sad when the fruit was the best part of the meal. \n\nLunch buffet cost about $9. A bargain, one might say, for a \""Vegas\"" buffet. All the strip buffets were starting around $30.\n\nThere's a reason why the restrooms are located at the exit of the restaurant with large, brightly-lit signs. Now, I love food, and if that food disagrees with my digestion but it tastes delicious, I'm willing to give a little leeway. When I eat a less than mediocre meal and additionally have the inconvenience and discomfort of immediately needing a restroom, I am not a happy camper. In toto, six out of our group of eight ended up in the restroom. The women's bathroom was clean, however, the males in our group recounted a disgusting state of the men's restroom.\n\nWhy 2 stars in stead of 1? Although the entire experience was sub-par, there is a possibility our 6 days of Vegas binging finally caught up to us and contributed to our sickened state. Even without sickness, not worth $9."
"1","The gym is clean and nice, but the contract/month to month whatever it is is not so great.  I apparently signed a contact last year, but thought I was doing month to month.  I left the gym because Custom Built Training left.  I tried to cancel my membership, but they told me it would be a large fee because I was in a contract.  Astonished that I actually was not month to month, I decided to just pay the last couple months.  The guy at the front desk stated that the auto pay would cancel when the contract expired.  In May I was charged again, but now also with at $29.00 annual fee.  I went into the gym and told my story.  They would not refund me even though I was misinformed by their staff.  Then...they had to nerve to tell me I needed to pay $25.00 to cancel my membership (even though my contract had expired).  I will not go back!  Apparently they need to ask the manager if I can be refunded, but guess what...no manager was there.   I doubt I will be seeing my money back.  Will not be recommending You Fit to others unless they step up and do the right thing by refunding me."
"3","Booking a table? Beware! Indoor tables are open for reservations. The patio and conservatory are not. For those wanting to forgo the dark, atmospheric inner room for the bright, light buzz of the other dining areas, be ready to wait the standard 20 minutes. \n\nI love that the interior does actually feel a little French, if not a little Disneyesque-French. The service is thoroughly American: friendly and completely casual. The food seems to be a hit-or-miss. And the lunch menu is not too exciting for food lovers.\n\nOur appetizers--baked cheese and onion soup au gratin--were filling, hearty and verrrrrry tasty! Our mains offered a totally different experience. The croque monsieur, sadly, was not at all hearty or rustic. If you're hoping it'll be an oven-toasted pairing of tasty French bread and gorgeous ham, don't. It's basically sub-par toasted ham and cheese sandwich, storebought sliced bread to boot. The steak sandwich was flavorful but already cold upon arrival. Fries here are unique. They are so thinly sliced that they're actually like chips/crisps--not like what I remember of bistro fries in France.\n\nGo here for the cute outdoor and conservatory seating, and view of the Bellagio fountains. Food is decent and filling--but nothing to write home about."
"5","My wife and I went there last night for our anniversary.  The service was first-rate, from start to finish.  The wait staff was friendly and helpful without ever being obtrusive or (as is sometimes the case in high end restaurants) condescending.  \n\nThe food was delicious, from starters to main courses to dessert.  There was a touch too much salt in a couple of the dishes for my taste, but otherwise everything was interesting, fresh, attractively presented, and tasty.  \n\nThe decor was spare, but tasteful.  The view is, of course, magnificent.  And there isn't really a bad table in the restaurant, upstairs or down.\n\nFinally, considering what you get, I think that the pricing is very reasonable.  I will definitely go back!"
"1","Got a tepid cup of coffee at 7:00 am that tastes like it was brewed with tea mixed in with it.  It doesn't appear these people can even do coffee correctly."
"1","Don't move into these apartment homes unless you love throwing away your money! I moved in and paid my holding, security, and cleaning fees. When I left after 3 years they charged me hundreds of dollars in more 'cleaning' fees. And the next person who moves in behind me will also be paying the fees twice too! They basically double charge every tenant. Despite the fact that I never took of advantage of the option for a repaint with a lease renewal (I never really had many scuffs or paint damage on my walls so why put maintenance through the trouble...?), when I moved out, they charged me for a repaint, carpet wear, and a spill in the fridge. Are you kidding me?! I lived there 3 years and kept the place immaculate and they forward me a bill for the wear and tear that any home would have after 3 years. I tried disputing the charges through the proper channels and was met with the standard run-around. The rent I was paying was already enough to give one pause but the property manager,Desirae, and Ovation Property Management are absolute crooks!!!"
"4","I really like this place a lot better now that they've moved from the Borgata.  It's a nice open floor plan and I love the outside patio and bar area.  My pizza was great and I'm pleased to see their nice selection of Italian wines."
"1","This buffet is overrated. Went to the $35 brunch a few years ago, decor of eating area was quite plain to say the least, compared to some of the other buffets around Vegas (ie: Paris, Rio).\n\nWhen i first walked in, the first item i saw was...Asian CONGEE?? What the heck?!!! In asian countries like China, Congee is seen as cheap street food. Here its actually one of the featured stations. Totally lame...\n\nAll the other brunch items were nothing out of the ordinary that you could not find at a cheaper buffet.\n\nNot worth the money. If there is one buffet in Vegas that really kicks butt, it's the Rio World seafood buffet. Money well spent there and good food!"
"4","Everything was excellent. Started with the Buffalo Blast appetizer! Amazing! The pizza and soup,were both good and of course the cheesecake was outstanding. The service was excellent and we waited less than 5 minutes to get in. The only problem I had with it (as seems to be the case with many restaurants in Vegas) is actually finding it."
"5","This place is always such helpful to me The employees greet you when you first walk in the door they are helpful to and it's always nice in the store this is by far my favorite Walgreens in Las Vegas I recommend everyone to come and check this one out"
"1","I had never eaten at this place before and my girlfriend and I were hungry so I thought we would take a chance here. There was no one in sight to seat us first of all, so we wandered inside looking at their decorated walls. After awhile someone approached us and had us sit at a booth. When it was time to order, all I wanted was this spicy shrimp pasta. When it came, it didn't come with a piece of bread or a cracker or anything else. I was a little disappointed because I love eating bread with my pasta. I asked our server if bread came with it as soon as he delivered it and he said \""no it doesn't but you can buy some.\"" I said no it was okay and then he proceeded to the couple on the booth behind us. I could clearly hear his conversation with the couple as he approached them and said, \""hey guys, chef put the wrong meat on the grill so you guys are going to be getting an even bigger steak\"" and I could hear how excited they were. Just hearing that right after I had my bread request dismissed really set me off internally. I understand that bread may not be free at this place or may not be given with pasta dishes but to hear someone get an even bigger piece of meat while I couldn't get a piece of bread just doesn't make sense to me. To add to this issue, service was really really slow. I don't see myself ever going to another TGI Fridays again."
"1","$13 for a 1/3 lb cheese burger. $6 fries? This place was waaay overpriced for 7th st and thunderbird area. $5.50 for a bottled beer? This place was absolutely terrible. I knew it was trouble when I saw a raw bar five feet from the bathrooms."
"1","Slow and lazy people. Took 3 hours with appointment to change the tires. Wheels were not torqued to correct specs, thanks god and I didn't get into accident."
"2","Called to order chicken wings and fries from the lady doing the orders from the phone she was rude and kept putting me on hold when I started ordering. Then the wait which was suppose to be 45 minutes turned out to be longer then that because the driver couldn't find my address despite me telling him the cross streets.  Finally get my food and the chicken wings are dry and there is more bone then meat on the wings and the fries were overcooked I threw it out I can't believe I wasted 30 bucks on that with the mozzarella sticks which was the only good thing pathetic avoid this place at all cost."
"5","I don't eat sashimi so I can't comment on their fish quality, but I do like cooked rolls and luckily Sushi San has a wide selection.  All the rolls I've tried are delicious and you probably can't go wrong with anything on the menu.\n\nWhat stands out the most to me about this restaurant is their amazing customer service.  I usually order to go and sometimes find \""extras\"" in my bag, such as miso soup, edamame, or even an entire extra roll!  The staff is super friendly and it's rare these days to find a restaurant with such a stellar level of customer service."
"2","This restaurant is so predictable it's deflating. I might put myself to sleep writing this. I'd like to write a thorough, in depth, review but honestly I just can't bring myself to put aside that much of my time for this place. \n\nLet me start by saying I've lived in No. Scottsdale for 15 years. Seen it all. \n\nIf you enjoy a bar that caters to the elite and the 'who do you know' crowd this is the place for you. The staff and food is as shallow as their attempt at making pizza, which, unfortunately, is what I ate for  dinner.  Sauce-no taste, nothing stood out on my sausage and onion pizza. Go to Lamp Pizza at Pinnacle Peak and Pima. They know what they're doing. \n\nThat's all I got. Nice atmosphere no soul at Isabella's :P"
"1","As a bit of a chili head, I have to say that I was very very excited about the atomic wing challenge here. Unfortunately, when we arrived we were informed that no such challenge existed anymore but they still have the wings. My coworkers and I excitedly ordered a round of the atomic wings and the wait began.\n\nWhile waiting for our food, the surroundings finally started to set in. I had noticed a bit of an odor when we arrived but hadn't paid it much mind. As it increased in intensity, I didn't have much of a choice anymore. Apparently, lunchtime is the ideal time of day to pump the raw sewage out and it just happened to run right through the door right in front of me. Not a good start.\n\nThe food finally arrives. This is going to be what makes it all worth it. I smell my wings and there is a little bit of noticeable tang and a some jalapenos on top. I take a bite nervously. Sort of cold. No noticeable spice. At all. Soupy wing sauce that doesn't taste very good on top of wings that I'm pretty sure just came from the grocer's freezer and found their way into Sport Pepper's microwave. Death knell.\n\nThe service wasn't bad but wasn't impressive either. Overall, between the dingy, dark decor, the overpowering smell of raw sewage, and the absolutely lackluster food, I just don't see myself ever being able to justify coming back.\n\nIt's unfortunate. I was really looking forward to this, too."
"3","Lots of different options and good pizza too! Our server was a little off, but mayeb she was just having a weird day."
"1","Mediocre facilities (from the shoe drop off area to the locker room to the actual studio), rude and uncaring staff. I don't know much about yoga; I am very flexible not necessarily in all that great of shape. I travel to a different city every week and recently tried Moksha yoga in Winnipeg, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Physically, heat is an issue for me because I don't sweat like normal people, so I am extremely prone to overheating/heat injuries. BYP was excessively critical of my need to drink water, rude about my need to have a full size towel, and I left class about 20 minutes early because of nausea relatedt to the heat. Between it being small and crowded, and carpeted, the studio was uncomfortable for reasons beyond the heat. I think having carpet in a hot humid atmosphere is gross-- the room smelled like a cross between feet and Florida in July/August. Not hygenic, or easy to clean the sweat pouring off most people. Instructors were snide and haughty; no one offered hands on corrections or modifications to poses; the instructor girl made a rude comment about one of her regulars at the beginning of class... I hated it. I paid for another class and much as I don't want to waste my money, I will not go back to those jerks. They had the berve to tell me after class that I might have been nauseous because I drank water... Well, 4 years in Special Operations, and I know what heat casualties are. Maybe they need drill sergeants and proper training. This place sucked."
"5","5 Stars! Not cause its a super duper fine dining place... but because it was great in food and experience. Yeah sure it's nothing to go Ape over, but I got everything I expected from this kind of place. Had some oyster shooters. Yum. Louisiana oysters... YUM YUM.\n\nOne thing I DO have to say is, they had the BEST snow crab I've ever had. The texture was good. Not mushy or cakey. Not super salty or watered down like the stuff you might find at buffets. And it had an awesome sweetness to it. I enjoyed it more than the lobster. And I love lobster over crab!\n\nGreat food. Check.\nGood drinks... check...\n...totally worth what you pay for.\n\nI left the place like a fatty.\n\nIf you don't want crawfish but have a seafood craving.. go here.\n\nIt might not satisfy everyone... but this place now tops Hot & Juicy and Boiling Crab for me!"
"4","Bachelorette party weekend.  Our last night in Vegas.  We wanted a fun and tasty dinner.  Brazilian BBQ!!\n\nCoupons!  They have coupons everywhere.. we got a $10 off every rodizio ordered!\n\nWe got the surf n' turf rodizio and the meat-only rodizio.\n\nWe were a big group.. the waiter was AWESOME.. was able to hook us up with buy one-get one pitchers of sangria.. AND a free dessert for me!\n\nThe meats and seafood were VERY tasty and cooked to perfection.. and the side/salad bar wasn't too much.. but the stuff I got were tasty!\n\nI'm so glad we had our dinner there.. it was a great experience and the food was very enjoyable!"
"3","Not that great of food. Limited wine selection. Not a kid friendly place yet I have kids around me. Would not visit again."
"2","Ick. Surprised this location has not been closed. There is seldom anyone there, the food is terrible and smells like dirty wet towels when you first walk in. Attention health dept, time for a spot check."
"1","Restaurant is closed."
"2","Mid Town Pub has been a frequent haunt but am going to have to find a new spot. A few weeks ago I ordered  the chicken cordon bleu sandwich. I was served another menu item that was chicken served with mounds of jalape\u00f1os. When I pointed out the error, they quickly replaced it... With the same sandwich sans jalape\u00f1os and added ham. Chicken was still steeped in jalape\u00f1o flavor. I didn't eat it but was charged for it.\n\n Wanted to give the kitchen another chance on a recent visit and was served yet another in edible sandwich. It was so salty and pepper ladened that the first bite was my last.\n\nThis kitchen needs some guidance! Adios mtp!"
"3","I was REALLY pumped up to go to this restaraunt.  I had wanted to go for a long time...the west side isn't known for fancy so I was excited to go to what may be higher end food than we usually get.  I wasn't dissapointed but it wasn't the best I'd had.  The appetizer was good, all sorts of little fried wonders!  Also, they brought out some warm yummy bread.  My first drink was amazing...Saguro Margarita...to die for!  Do it!  I got the fish special for dinner and it was a little dry for my taste.  The rest of my group however got the lamb and loved it.  I will go again and hopefully then can report a higher rating."
"5","I found the show to be extremely entertaining and funny as hell.  A great interaction with the crowd and hilarious impersonations.   The finale was my favorite.   I loved that he met with everyone after the show and thanked them personally for coming out.   If you're in Vegas go check this show out!"
"3","In an effort to avoid the alleged long lines of L'Avenue during the weekend brunch rush, I refrained from coming here until the Monday of my vacation in Montreal.  \n\nI walked in around 10am.  I think there was one couple in the entire restaurant.  The plan was successful!\n\nIt's a spunky looking restaurant, and shaped in a rectangle with tables and chairs lining all the way down, and the cooking going on across the other side.  There are a couple of manikins strategically placed and in funny positions.  The menu is entirely in French, so if you don't speak a word - either bring a dictionary (like I did), or if you've joined the modern technological world (unlike me), use a phone app to translate - and you're golden.  Who knew champignon meant mushroom. ;-)  \n\nI ordered the eggs benedict that comes over French toast instead of an English muffin (ha ha, nice), with the maple syrup on the side.  I think it's called the Benedict Sucre or something along those lines.   The service is nice and friendly, but not hugely attentive.  Nearly ten minutes went by before they came to take my order, even though they saw my menu closed and  I was the only one waiting to order..  but they were standing around talking with one another.  Granted my French is non-existent, I think they were training a new employee...  based off of the body language.  \n\nI ordered a cup of coffee, but it was kind of lukewarm.  Oh well.  I came for the benedict anyhow.  Which was..  a delicious sight for the eyes!  Thick slices of brioche French toast, thin slices of ham, nicely poached eggs, and a buttery Hollandaise generously smeared over it all.  A small cruet of maple syrup and cup of sauteed potatoes in the center.  And a skewer of fresh fruit.  (truly enjoyed that about Montreal..  as they bring you fruit and/or salad with almost every meal)  \n\nThe Hollandaise was a bit heavy, and next time I'd ask for them to go easy on it - albeit it's very yummy and velvety.  \n\nPrices are a bit high, but you do get a ton of good food for it, and so a benedict dish with a cup of coffee will run you about $20 including the tip.  \n\nIt's located a couple of blocks away from the Mont Royal metro station.  A great place to walk afterward is down the opposite way (westward) towards St. Denis - lots of shopping opportunities.  If you're looking for poutine, it's not far from here (15 min walk?) at La Banquise.  Schwartz' smoked meats is about a 30 min walk southwest."
"3","I liked it! Mind you, I am not a fro-yo snob. Not in the least bit. The only frozen yogurt I had until last year was from TCBY or DQ. The only other chain I've been to besides TCBY is Golden Spoon. So, the U-Swirl. It is self serve, which I love. I can have tons of different tastes, so this fit me pretty well. It was very clean even though it was busy and there were a lot of families there. The service was also pretty quick. \nI like the selection of toppings, from fruit to cereal (captain crunch makes anything better). The yogurt tasted very good, and not too artificial (the red velvet tasted exactly like cake, and was very very rich). I thought the price was pretty good $.36/ounce, but then again, I've not been to a lot of fro-yo places. I paid less here than I do for the same amount at Golden Spoon or a place like Coldstone, so I was happy."
"3","I've been going here during the week, and in bad weather it is hard to tell it is even open.  There are some things I really love here and some that I don't.  The flowers are a steal and beautifully arranged, though they do not last very long - maybe two or three days.  There are some really good deals on produce, and I have gotten some great tomatoes and peaches in season.  However, about half of the stuff is not local.  I had a hard time finding a local apple, and a lot of the produce has sku stickers on it telling you that it's from california or washington or whatever.  Still, there are some local farmers interspersed in there and they make it worth it.  I still will visit regularly."
"2","There were six of us who went just after the lunch crowd was over.  My first impression is that the place could use a good scrubbing.  Also, the girl taking our order at the counter had zero personality.\nI ordered menudo which was some of the best that I have had.  My husband and I also ordered the tamale platter.  We both ordered beef tamales.  We each got one beef, one corn.  They were just okay.  I am glad that all of our orders came out in styrofoam \""to go\"" containers even though we were eating there, because I saw everyone getting their orders of cheap, flimsy paper plates that ended up being soggy.  One couple ordered tostadas.  There was more lettuce than beans or cheese.\nI can tell you that I will never go back.  The food is definitely not authentic."
"1","I got pushed here from the flamingo for a night. Even though it's free don't do it. Pay to go elsewhere.  Service was terrible. Check in was forever long and there was no expedite for total reward tiers."
"4","Very nice RV resort. It has two pools, hot tub, gym, caf\u00e9, store, ball room, movies, laundry, horse shoes, dog walks, putting course, cable TV and of course showers and bathrooms.\nIt's close to the strip, Fry's Electronics, Whole Foods, shopping, restaurants and theaters.\nThe sites have picnic tables, water, electric and sewer. No tent camping.\nOur site has grass and is a pull thru.\nPet's are allowed. They do have a no pet section. Three dog's are the maximum, county ordnance. They have several dog walk area's throughout the park, with baggies to clean up the dogs droppings. Unfortunately, some people are above cleaning up after their dogs.\nAs far as the no rigs over ten year rule as someone else has mentioned, it not quite like that. They need to see your rig and give approval if its over ten years. From the looks of some of the rigs in here, its not that strict, so unless your driving a real clunker I wouldn't worry.\nThis is also a monthly park, which is great if you are a snowbird, I have spoken to a few locals that also stay here."
"2","I do enjoy the italian bread here, but there isn't enough meat, cheese or topping to enjoy it! I definitely hate to say it but subway is just on the NW corner off the 101 and Shea. Its pretty expensive and not very loaded with toppings."
"1","These mother fuckers hit an ran my car! Eye witness took down their cab number and license plate. Your busted!"
"5","I haven't been to a better buffet in vegas, than this one! \n\nFood: they have just about EVERYTHING you could think of.  Full salad bar (even with multiple types of lettuce).  Soups, breads, all different kinds of meats, seafood (crab, shrimp, sushi, sashimi), pastas, omelets, and much much more.  there is a huge selection of desserts, and they even have ice cream/gelato that they scoop for you on the spot, and put on toppings. yum!  Ive been here a couple times, and the food is always fresh. \n\nService: even though the line is rather long, the wait time isnt actually that bad. The wait is well worth it though.  The staff is nice, the cooks/chefs behind the counters are friendly, and the waiters that occasionally come around are efficient. \n\nAmbiance: the decorations are so extravagant and pretty! they always have fresh flowers.  there is a TON of natural daylight, so the space always feels fresh.  it almost feels like you are outdoors.  very pleasant place to have lunch/dinner. \n\nPrice: rather expensive, but for what you get.. well worth it! \n\nIf you go here, be sure not to fill up on bread and pasta.  go for the seafood! yum! \n\nI would definitely eat here again when i'm in vegas!"
"3","Les filles du roi is a highly rated restaurant in books and this website. I found the service to be exemplary and the d\u00e9cor to be charming, old school style. But the food wasn't that great and neither were the main dish selections. My appetizer was made from filo dough and stuffed with honey, goat cheese and walnuts. It came with a spinach salad. This was the best part of the meal and very yummy tasting! Then I had the stuffed rabbit. It wasn't that tasty and I personally think \""Comme chez soi\""'s rabbit is 100 times better. My colleague had the traditional Quebec food platter and mentioned that most of it was tasteless too. So overall, I would avoid this place given the price to taste ratio."
"2","huge disappointment. we came here for brunch on v-day. why brunch? because every other day we tried to come here for dinner, it was completely booked. or so they say. we tried to walk in, seeing that there were at least 8-10 empty tables. but according to the hostesses, they were full. humph. hey, thanks for NOT telling us we could eat at the bar. the hostesses are so snotty is almost laughable. You think you're so high and mighty because you work at a tex-mex restaurant? anyways, i had the spicy chicken and sweet potatoes. sounds yummy, right? yes, if i wanted sweet potato pie. i found a couple of small pieces of chicken floating in that mess.  well, in their defense, i had the leftovers in my room a few hours later, and it was tasted okay (mind you, four drinks later). my husband had the steak and eggs, which was more like a \""build your own mini steak taco.\"" it was reminiscent of chevy's steak fajitas, only chevy's tasted a lot better."
"1","So, after doing much research, hoping to find a great alternative to my usual spot for AYCE sushi, I decided on Oyshi, solely because of the great reviews I saw here on Yelp. \n\nI looked up the website, called and asked about prices, and finally my boyfriend and I decided to make the trip out. \n\nWe arrived at about 8:30pm, and it was a Friday night, so I expected it to be bustling. During our wait to be seated,  I scoped out the crowd, and noticed the usual. Mostly those under the age of 30, large groups of them in fact, and figured this must be their spot before they hit the clubs, considering their attire. Well, it was either that or the fact that the music in the restaurant sounded as if you were already in a night club. It must be set on Pandora or something. Anyway, it was only about a 15 minute wait, which wasn't bad at all. \n\nSo, besides my observations of the restaurant ambiance and demographic, we finally were able to look at the menu. My boyfriend usually orders the nigiri, so we got the usual garlic tuna, albacore, cajun albacore, and decided to try the Oyshi scallops. As for the rolls, I decided on the Sibuya No Rice, Coco, and a Bonsai. I also decided to get the agedashi tofu, grilled beef asparagus, baked mussels and seaweed salad. This was only the first round after all.\n\nWe were excited to eat until the food arrived on our table. First the nigiri, the presentation was obviously not of any importance, but you can't judge a book by its cover, so we took a few bites anyway. \n\nVerdict, \n\nthe garlic tuna was DISGUSTING. It smelled and tasted like spoiled blood. I've had garlic tuna many times at many other restaurants, and this one had to be the worst. It even looked slimy, not because of the sauce, just itself.\n\nthe albacore was seared, and also tasted old. It had the same garlic sauce poured over it as the garlic tuna, and it was mushy.\n\nthe Oyshi scallops I thought were going to be \""OISHI\"" but, definitely not. They mixed it with crab meat, and very light mayo, and it fell apart immediately as I tried to pick it up. \n\nthe cajun albacore had TOO MUCH cajun seasoning! I usually love cajun albacore, and this was too much for my palate, on top of that it was DRY.\n\nmy boyfriend got his usual spicy tuna hand rolls as well, and the spicy tuna looked a little spoiled. \n\non to the rolls,\n\nthe Bonsai, had the cajun albacore on it as well, but I had to bear it to see if the spicy tuna in the center was at least average. The roll as a whole was not to my liking.\n\nthe Coco, was probably the most decent roll on table, probably because each of the ingredients in it were fully cooked.\n\nthe Sibuya No Rice, again with the spicy tuna... eh.\n\nthe appetizers,\n\nthe agedashi tofu is usually my favorite appetizer!!! It came out looking as if it were just fried up, and I commend the presentation on this one, but the center was cold, the sauce was not tasty, and I hate that it is not \""bite-size\"" as most Japanese cuisine is known to be. \n\nthe seaweed salad was not a bright green and although it was crispy, it had an ugly after taste, I've had better, let's just leave it at that.\n\nthe grilled beef asparagus was drizzled in teriyaki sauce. The asparagus was perfect, but the beef wrapped around it was dry somehow.\n\nthe baked mussels were not baked enough, and the yumyum sauce was pretty tasteless. \n\nI was disappointed already, but decided to take another round of appetizers, since I knew the sushi wasn't going to be very enjoyable. I settled for calamari, shrimp/veg tempura, edamame, asian style skirt steak, and some other things that were just not memorable enough.\n\nI knew it was bad when I was scarfing down edamame and tempura. The calamari looked good, but the dipping sauces  (ranch and a mayo/mustard mix) could have been more \""asian\"" I guess? My boyfriend ate the skirt steak (aka Korean bulgogi, in my opinion). He even commented \""I'm eating beef, which is probably the last thing I would expect to eat at a Sushi restaurant.\""\n\nWith that said, it smelled as if something was burning the entire night we were there! \n\nHm, it was overall a disappointing experience.  We have both gone to many sushi restaurants, with my list including restaurants in Hawaii and San Francisco, California, and I wanted to seriously give this place a chance. Unfortunately, Oyshi just did not live up to the hype!\n\nOn a side note though, my waitress was very helpful, and service was mediocre, but that's about it."
"5","This place is great for breakfast, lunch or dinner. I actually had the chopped salad EVERY day we were there, it was that good. \n\nI highly recommend the blood orange mimosas for breakfast, and they make them table side! \n\nMy husband has the filet mignon breakfast sliders. They were incredible!!!\n\nI read the reviews about the salmon, and I was wary, but I got it anyway, and it was PERFECT.\n\nDid I mention the Bailey's float I got for dessert!? Amazing."
"3","Well they no longer have the Chicken Strip Cheese sandwich and what they replaced it with pretty much sucks. Other than that its like a normal hooters with some new wing flavors and steak fries."
"3","Love the bagels.  But . . . Need to have the boxes ready for grab and go. Never seem to have them ready when I get here, thus waiting in line contrary to the program. Bummer."
"4","There are very few restaurants that make me sit back and think about how I should be kinder to chain restaurants when I write reviews. And Les 3 Brasseurs was one of the those lucky few. While there is not way to avoid chain restaurants all the time. I try to support local places. So bare with me as I explain to you why I love this place. \n\nI was in Montreal for the weekend, visiting friends from Uni. I was also there with a friend from Cincinnati, taking him on his first Canadian adventure. On our first night, we were on our own and up to our devices for getting dinner. We chose Les 3 Brasseurs mostly because they brewed their own beer. I mean as a beer lover, that is just heaven for me. We got placed at the bar because it was a crowded Friday night. The bartender was very attentive and very beautiful. She was more then happy to speak English. And she pretty much gave us a college level course on their beer selection. We went with two liters of the Amber. I mean we were planning on drinking, might as well go \""balls to the wall\"". Along with our beer, we ordered their Poutine. And while I try not to explain food as orgasmic. A plate of their poutine maxi is just that, orgasmic. My friend had the open faced seafood sandwich. And I ordered the Quebec Flammekuchen. Covered in a local cheese,bacon and onion. It was so good. We became friends with a few of our fellow bar sitters. And with the assistant to the bartender, he wasn't a busboy and he was allowed to take orders, just not pour them. Weird? Anyway. We kept ordering beer and shots of Sortilege ( a wonderful maple bourbon that is just amazing). Before we knew it, it was 2am. And we were very well gone. So with a few of our new friends we met at Les 3, we moved to a cheaper drinking hole. And the rest of the night is kinda blurry after that. But I will always eat here when I am in Montreal. Hell, until I find a better place. This will be my favorite place to eat in Montreal! Bring on the flame war."
"4","I raised my rating to four stars due to I returned for lunch today. The restaurant is close to where our conference was being held and was squeezed on time. I tried the lunch special - a bowl of curry on rice and a bowl of pork ramen with miso broth. Food tasted better today and was less salty.(Maybe because I drank last night?) The portion of ramen was still quite large and curry was very tasty for a bargain price of $12.95 including tip."
"4","= = = = = =  CLOSED!  = = = = = =\n\nSo sad, so sad...  we've lost yet another Souper Salad!     :-((     There were 16 of them in the Valley a while back & now we're down to THREE!  The problem?  THEY DON'T CHARGE ENOUGH FOR THE BUFFET!!  I certainly hope they'll finally see the light & raise the price a couple dollars at the remaining locations so we'll still have them around to enjoy!     :-O"
"4","This is by far the best BBQ place in Phoenix IMO.  The only problem that I always ran into is what to get.  All the meats are smoked to perfection and the link are spiced just the way i like it.\n\nThe BBQ sauce is so good that I keep a gallon of this wonder in my fridge at all times.\n\nOh, and they also have Alcohol!!"
"1","i thought pharmacists were supposed to help people. if i could give less then 1 star i would. the woman here treats every patient like a drug addict. my sister had just got out of the hospital after having her gall bladder removed and this woman wouldnt fill her prescription. i would go anywhere but here. and i wish i could do more than just leave this review."
"1","Setting: nice dim lighting and pretty decorations.\n\nAYCE menu: food was ok. I ordered uni and hamachi kama but they were \""sold out\""...which I don't see how since their restaurant was empty.\n\nService: They lost our order list and found it sometime later so we got a huge pause in between our dishes. They even messed up our dessert orders for vanilla when we ordered green tea tempura ice cream. None of them really smile at you. \n\nAn overall bad first time experience. I don't think we'll be coming back."
"2","Why would you eat at this cartoonish, small-children-infested sideshow when you could eat at Frank & Fina's across the street?!\n\nWe almost walked out as soon as we walked in, and I wish that we had.\n\nWhen you walk into this restaurant, the ambiance stresses you out. The fake Mexican decor and the immense amount of noise in the place are just too much. If you want a peaceful meal, eat elsewhere. \n\nThe food was laughable, though the waiters were friendly."
"2","Only 2 Stars: Z-Pizza on Thomas: Haven't been here in a while because we have been going to the nearby FIRED PIE at Park Central instead, which is waaaay better!  But I received an e-mail for a free small pizza for my birthday, so we decided to return to z-pizza for that. I ordered the Thai Pizza & was disappointed....  The peanut sauce lacked any yummy flavor, quite bland, & it was missing one of the toppings that it was supposed to have....no carrots. I complained up at the counter, & to compensate, they gave me a free drink. That was nice of them, but they should have told me up front, & not assume that I wouldn't realize that one of the toppings was missing, because I used to get the Thai Pizza all the time & I remember lots of carrots on it!  There was hardly any red onions or bean sprouts on it either!  However, there was a fair amount of chicken on it.  I will not be returning to z-pizza again.  FIRED PIE, here we come!~  Also, the chairs make a LOT of noise there when they're moved around...annoying!"
"5","One of the greatest dining experiences I've had all year, maybe all life.\nBurger was succulent, excellent roll, each bite was juicy and delicious.\nThe Oreo Milkshake had some amazing aftertastes, and the entire experience from onion rings to fried pickles was a heavy one.  I went into a food coma afterwards for about 1/2 a day.  We ate at 4 p.m., and I was done for the rest of the day!\n\nHighly, highly recommended."
"5","David Woolen always does a fantastic job - friendly, courteous and careful around areas where pets and kids play. I appreciate Bulwark Exterminating's always fantastic customer service."
"5","I have been going for a few months regularly and I love the facility and the staff. Dr. Brim is an amazing chiropractor. He takes the time to understand your personal needs and creates a plan to get you on the right track."
"5","Let's be real. I cannot imagine a better Saturday afternoon activity than drinking a yard-cup of sugary alcoholic frozen splendor and floating/walking down a lazy river all afternoon. Combine them and ... pure. magic.\n\nAlso, this place is a meat market. (Meet Market?) Regardless, listening to/receieving pick-up lines in Vegas are a sport in and of themselves."
"3","The spa is definitely worth it, $22/hr! Its not the cleanest but the massage was good; you get what you pay for. Do not have high expectations here**\n\nThe spa is a large room with semi private open rooms in it, where you can hear everything from the room next door. The bathrooms are not the cleanest so if you dont have to go, just wait. \nThey greet you with a large bucket of warm water with a plastic bag wrapped around it to soak your feet in. When the man massaged my feet he applied just the right pressure, very relaxing. \n\nOverall, I would go again! It's worth the price; I will just use the bathroom before going inside."
"3","This place is correct. A perfect 3.5. I had an old fashioned which was just okay (I'm not a big fan of crushed ice on my old fadhioneds) and a burger which was good. \n\nThe place feels like the evolution of the Squirrel Cage - you can't smoke in here, the music is fine and everyone seems friendly enough. The drinks aren't terribly expensive But the food isn't super cheap. \n\nLike I said, I would totes give this place a 3.5 and if you've never been I highly recommend it! But it's not a 4. \n\nThat said, on the right night this place can be a 5 - great ambiance and lots of potential to have a great night here."
"2","Came here with a friend for lunch and sat on the roof top deck. Aces for that! We started with the fried pickle. Love FP, but these were a poor representation of them. Greasy and the batter was peeling off. I had the brisket with sweet potato, oh! That's right. I didn't get what I ordered. I over cooked greasy fries like everyone else. The brisket was very good thought. It had shoe string onion rings and slaw on it. The meat was a bit over cooked. It was a beautiful day to hand with friends on the sunny deck!"
"1","no no no no no. got suckered into going here because of their buy-one, get-one-free coupon(look on web).\nordered rare, but was cooked almost medium brown. beef is poor quality (2 bone chips + gristle) and not flavorful.\nthe balsamic onions were overmarinted and the onions included, amazingly, *onion rind* -- yes, the hard outside layers of the onion were added to the burger toppings. NASTY.\nstay away."
"5","Found this place about 15 years ago.  You guessed right....a referral.  Been referring and using ever since.  This is a no nonsense - CUSTOMER SERVICE oriented family business.  The staff is the same since the original trip.  \n\nIf you are looking for fair pricing, personal service and no \""extra\"" suggested  upselling, this is a great place for you.  Wouldnt even think of taking my vehicles anywhere else.  Special thanks to this staff that goes out of their way for the little things too."
"2","This place has to be the worst steak house in all of Las Vegas in terms of food quality.  The steak was tough with no marbling.  I ordered a salad and got these three massive strips of bacon with a couple of pieces of lettuce.  Some of the things sounded good but they just weren't.\n\nOur meal was comped and to steal a line from my boss \""it aint worth free\""...and truly it wasn't.\n\nIn fairness, the vibe is good and the waiter was very nice."
"2","I recently went here for the first time last week with my new dog. Nothing special, same items as any old PetSmart or PetCo, they carry both holistic food and the poison grocery store food as well. The female cashier was not very impressive, looked as though she didn't shower that day...very unkempt...not friendly.. \""hello\"" as people walked in but with no personality. A man in front of me said he had purchased a bag of biscuits but they were stale, had his receipt and asked if he could grab another. Instead of tactfully saying \""of course\"" and taking back the bag they would get credit for anyways, the girl sort of gave him a hassle and was unfriendly. BAD for business to act that way. Hire people who care, not local highschool kids who don't give a damn."
"3","The New York Sirloin was cooked well, but it was pretty tough. The online menu said they had prime rib, which is why we came, but they don't even sell it. Our server Bryan was very good"
"1","I don't often write reviews...but the service and food here warrants one.  I was really hoping to like this place, but sadly I was VERY disappointed.  The staff was rude and seemed disinterested.  The food was, in a word, horrible.\n\nI had the cheese enchilada plate, a steak taco, and a chicken taco.  I don't know what they put on the enchilada, but it definitely wasn't enchilada sauce.  The \""steak\"" was just charred pieces of (I guess) beef.  The chicken was bland.\n\nI may give it another shot in the future, but first impression was terrible.  I guess I will give Gordo's a chance tonight...hoping for something better."
"3","I've passed this place several times since it opened and I kept saying I wanted to come here based off the few pics the yelpers had posted, but I was disappointed that they were out of 2 of items I wanted to order. They were all out of brisket and the baker had not come in yet to make most of the pastries so it was very limited. The cashier was nice the and the cafe gave u the feeling of being in a lil cafe somewhere other than in Vegas ( which was refreshing). \n  With all that being said, my husband ordered the sirloin burger which I might add was huge and he enjoyed it! I however ordered the avocado burger which is advertised w a pretzel bun, which it wasn't. Now this might seem very minute to some, but my agreement is u can't just serve a burger on a sesame bun and not even acknowledge that u changed the bun all together.. \n   All in all my husband enjoyed his meal so it wasn't like the food was bad but they need to fix some inconsistencies."
"3","The prices are not too exorbitant for a movie theater that has seat-side service.  I have had some stale popcorn here and the food can be hit and miss, but other than that I really have no complaints.  On Sundays Studio Movie Grill has $5 glasses of house white wine and $10 all-you-can-eat, one-topping pizzas.  And the pizzas are not horrible; I am always leery of 'bottomless' food.  I had chicken nachos once and they were weak, lacking cheese and chicken with a huge pile of lettuce on top...more like a salad.  On the bright side, drinks are always kept topped up and seats are relatively comfortable; just make sure to get a table seat not a counter seat."
"1","This 24-hour Wal-Mart Supercenter is \""ghetto,\"" and when I say that I am by no means dissing their fine, diverse community of customers. I'm talking about the store, the condition of the store, and they way they treat you. \n\nPro: I bought a tire from their auto department, they mounted it quickly and charged me a fair price.\n\nCon: The store is dirty. The employees can be nasty. They are often out of staple items like milk and bread and soft drinks. They have few checkers, they try to steer you to self-checkout machines that don't work, you will stand there waiting forever for someone to come and fix the self-checkout machine. They are obsessed with stopping you on the way out of the store and checking your receipt, a practice which is of questionable legality. And the self-checkout machines are obsessed with calling you a thief (\""Unauthorized item in the bagging area! Attendant has been called!\"")\n\nGo a couple of miles southwest to the Wal-Mart Supercenter at 540 Marks Street which is cleaner, better lit, better marketed, and has what you need. For groceries you should be shopping at Winco Foods."
"5","The absolute best property in Scottsdale. Nothing else compares. Not least of all because of property manager Rebecca, the best in the business."
"2","The service was adequate the food was not.  Overpriced and lacking flavor.  I had the short rib taco, pork belly taco, and the pastor taco.  None were what I describe as \""good\"" or even approaching noteworthy.  The chips and guacamole were pretty standard, but when you ask $9 for guac it should be something special imo.  \n\nMaybe my standards are high, but this was just a culinary disappointment."
"5","After being curious about Brazilian waxes for years, but always too scared to actually make an appointment, my good friend found Salon D'Shayn and recommended that I go to Courtenay to have my Brazilian wax virginity taken. I am SO GLAD I finally mustered up the courage to book an appointment because I am forever changed. Not only is Courtenay super professional and fun, but the wax experience was almost painless! Not at all what I was expecting, but in the best way possible. She makes you feel super comfortable the whole time and will even sing you some Frank Sinatra while she works her magic on your nether regions. :) I highly recommend Salon D'Shayn - the salon is funky, fun, and everyone makes you feel welcome. Plus with 50% off waxes for first time clients, you can't go wrong! Book an appointment with Courtenay, you won't be disappointed."
"4","The bad: the bar closes at 10pm.  It seems like the western, country, wagon-wheel themed bar that you'd like to close down one night while playing some good tunes on the juke box and eating peanuts.  And also the french fries, file those under bad.\n\nThe good: the hamburgers are pretty much delicious.  Definitely go for guacamole, and add whatever you want from the topping wagon.\n\nI didn't try one myself, but I hear the cookies are good."
"3","I'm a fan! It's down Fleshmarket Close, or up Fleshmarket Close depending on your starting point.\n\nAs such, you can stop in for a pint on the way up and tell yourself \""it's because it's a nice pub!\"" rather than the more truthful \""I'm knackered already and I need a sit down\"" that usually happens.\n\nThe staff are friendly, the prices are reasonable, the atmosphere is standard Edinburgh quiet-ish pub. There's not a lot of difference between this and say, a dozen other pubs in the city centre, bar the location - but I always pop in. It has that homely feel to it.\n\nGive it a go!"
"5","Michael's is my favorite place to have things framed.  The selection of frames is huge.  They have a good selection of acid free papers and lots of choices for cuts and bevels as well. Their prices are reasonable, even more reasonable if you wait for their half off framing coupons that appear in the newspaper at least twice a month.   I have had no less than 50 lithos, photos, paintings and such framed by Michael's and they have never damaged anything or caused me worry over any of them.   They are not the quickest, but they have work done when they say it will be done."
"2","I don't know man. My dude and I came in here for some drinks before our reservation over at Herbs & Rye and as soon as I walked in I had a bad vibe. I thought the bartender was friendly but the crowd was pretty shifty.  A random guy came over and just started bragging about his job and the people he worked with.  A woman from across the bar kept looking over at me, even after I gave her a good stare down. \nThe best part was that 2 beers and 2 shots of Jameson came in under $10-15. \n \n I like my drinks cheap and this place did that for me, but I also like to be comfortable in my surroundings.  Not sure if I'd come back."
"4","Decent airport, but it is always a mass of humanity.  Be sure to stay in your seat if you get one, because you will lose it."
"5","I have been going to this dental office for a few years now after my dentist I had for more than a decade went out of network. The main reason I am giving them 5 stars is because I missed an appointment and did not get charged a \""no show fee.\"" Most dental/medical offices charge some type of fee for those type of occurrences. I was also late a few times and the office staff were totally understanding about it. At my other dentist the receptionist would always give me that \""ugh\"" attitude. I also want to mention Dr. Kern fixed my crown which always caught food in it. I've been to two other dentists with the same crown, although they noticed it they didn't really do much about it, so I can truthfully say he cares. Dr. Kern went to UNLV for his dental degree, if that adds a slight bit of a wow factor  The women up front are friendly for the most part and it's pretty easy to schedule an appointment. If you're looking for a dentist and come across Courtesy I definitely recommend them."
"5","This place is a gem. A rare combination of great coffee and zero pretension. Where most higher-end coffee shops tend to be snobbish, Espresso A Mano is always warm and inviting and the baristas working there are always at the top of their game. No matter how big the line is you will always be served in minutes and your drink will be well made every single time. I rarely take the time to write reviews but this place is worthy of all of the praise it receives. Pay a visit once and I guarantee they will learn your first name and never forget it."
"3","Meh...nothing special.  Brunch price was about 23.95 and 28.95 if you wanted unlimited mimosas.  I thought the food was eh... I didn't really eat too much to be honest b/c I was so dehydrated!  They had all the usual breakfast foods.  Friends enjoyed the pesto mashed potatoes..I thought it tasted kinda different... I only enjoyed the penne pasta with marinara...the most simple thing on there to eat, but that's all I liked.  Didn't try the prime rib but it was very rare so be forewarned if you don't like red meat.  Spicy tuna handroll was ok. Good selection of breads. Fruits weren't too sweet.  And the only part to every meal I look forward to was dessert...and that was a disappointment.  They didn't have creme brulee...just flan...but it tasted bitter. Bread pudding was ok...nothing spectacular.  My man was particularly impressed that they served fresh carrot juice.  Service I must say was excellent.  Oh...and one more thing... if you have a party of 8 or more, they automatically charged you an 18% gratuity.  That in itself blows.  Especially for a buffet.  Yeah yeah..it's Vegas... still.  Bogus.\n\nI think I'm just too darn picky of an eater though...so don't take my review too much at heart.  :)"
"1","Went for lunch. Wife order Cobb salad. I order prime rib open face sandwich. Slow but food finally came. Wife looked salad and said no eggs or avocados  waiter said they were out. I could not cut prime rib with steak knife  did bring another. Worse than first. Left hungry"
"3","Granted your first impression of these high rise condos is most likely gonna be around the lines of \""ghetto\"" BUT once you get past the exterior, you'll find out real quick that the inside of the condos are built quite nicely. A friend of mine happens to own a 2 bedroom condo in the VT and once inside I was amazed at how spacious the condos were. My friend is photographer and requires an area where he can place large equipment and back drops. And the view on the outside patio? for get about it, its fabulous! \n\nDont get me wrong, the area is most defintiely not the best area, its crowded and there are alot of ghetto ass people around, but I think for the price he pays around $715 for a 2 br/2bath 1200+ square feet, its a great deal!"
"1","Treasure Island... what have you done to yourself? \n\nEmbarrassing.\n\nOne of my fondest memories from my childhood visits to Las Vegas had to have been the ever popular British vs. The Pirates battle at the front of the hotel. \n\nThe British arrived to try and rain on the pirate parade, but the pirates triumphed and told you to come join them in their paradise.. the hotel behind them...\n\nIt was by far (and yes, even more so than the Bellagio..) the most popular free show on the strip. The crowd would gather and make it nearly impossible to move with 15 minutes to go to show time. It was a spectacle every hour.\n\nThen someone got the bright idea to pretend that Treasure Island was just a clever name for a adult club and people would pretend it wasn't meant for kids. So you slapped some half naked women on the boats and made that your thing... and it didn't work out.. \n\nNow.. there is no more show. The pirate ships sit being dismantled.. and in their place.. exactly what Vegas is dying to have more of.. shops.\n\nFor shame.. and a waste of the best free show in Vegas (before they turned it into a burlesque show)"
"2","Uncomfortable beds, tiny cramped rooms, and too far away from everything. I guess you can't beat the price, though - hence the two stars. And the tourists are great to hustle at the poker table. Oh, and the blackjack dealers are all scantily dressed and dolled up - so that's a plus if you like that sort of stuff."
"3","So, it was our first visit to Pelican Bay, and we'll certainly be returning!\n\nNow, their prices are a bit...steep(I'm talking about normal menu items, not specials). However, it's just around the corner from us, and such a lovely, cozy little hole-in-the-wall that I can't resist loving it.\n\nI had the peel-and-eat-shrimp(regular...I'll have to try Cajun-style another time). it consisted of about 25 small shrimp and a side of cocktail sauce(I think it was housemade). I added some of the Tapatio hot sauce(there's a bottle on every table), and enjoyed my shrimp whilst swigging 2 Negra Modelos. my meal(excluding the beer) was $9.95\n\nJamie had the steak sandwich--a giant slab of steak on hoagie bread. price? $9.95. it came with french fries(effing FABULOUS steak fries)...but apparently, they were $2 extra. wtf? whatever...they were well worth it; so amazing drizzled with malt vinegar(again, a bottle on every table) and salt.\n\nour total bill? $29.50. a little crazy, to be honest...but, the bartender(owner?) was attentive, and they have a fabulous selection of seafood and Mexican food. unfortunately, the beer selections were lacking. stick with Negra, and you're golden.\n\nnext time...either the seafood cocktail(octopus optional), the ceviche tostada, or the steamed clams :p"
"2","I went here once because one of the Pitt clubs was doing a fundraiser here, and I'm not sure if it was just this location, but I wasn't impressed. \n\nI got a pumpernickel bagel with plain cream cheese. The bagel was thin and pretty bland. There was barely any cream cheese on there, and what WAS there was poorly spread around. \n\nThe location is good and it's cheap, but you'd have better luck going to Einstein's bagels, or even getting a Panera bagel- instead."
"3","The staff was super friendly,  and had good service. This was our first time getting pizza from here. Good prices. Unfortunately the pizzas were not that great. Not enough sauce and the sauce that was there was bland. Crust was pretty tasteless. Just average at best, was hoping for better"
"4","Not bad, not bad, check it out.\n\nOK!  If you are going for all you can eat sushi, then this probably means  you like the complicated so many flavor and stuff type of sushi. In this case, this place is just fine and you cannot go wrong.\n\n1.  For a lunch place, it is perfect. Just the right size, not too crowded and roomy.\n\n2.  Parking - Easy Strip Mall Parking.\n\n3.  Car Wash - No, just kidding, but hey, you can drop your car off at the Chevron across the street , have it washed and enjoy a good sushi meal.\n\n3.  Pricing - Just right at 21.99 all you can eat.\n\n4.  Quality - No bad!  Now I am more of a traditionalist when it comes to sushi and prefer the basic Nigiri Sushi style with the seafood on top of rice.  However, I can and will enjoy the American invented sushi rolls and here they are tasty and inventive.  the Screaming Orgasm is very tasty and different!  I enjoyed everything that we ordered!\n\n5.  Service - Just right amount of service. Just right amount of help!\n\nSide note, being of asian persuasion, I am quite sensitive to the cleanliness of the bathroom. The ole adage is that if the bathroom in the Chinese restaurant is clean, the food is bad.  Well, here,the bathroom is quite good and the food is good. So, it is a Win-Win!!!\n\nCheck it out."
"3","Came here tonight while on a vegas trip with the boyfriend and some friends. We wanted some sushi at somewhere that was reasonably affordable and could also use our MLife card so we came here.\n\nIt was a bit hard to find in the casino but we eventually got to it. It is beautifully decorated, clean, and has a nice relaxing ambiance. \n\nOur server was polite, prompt and eager to please. She made several suggestions for us and we were checked on by her and other employees there. Our drinks were always full so they earned points there.\n\nWe ordered miso soup and four sushi rolls (spicy tuna, las vegas, dragon roll and the aloha roll). The miso soup was delicious. It was fresh and full of flavor. The sushi rolls were just ok. I was hoping to walk away with an overall great experience but I just could not get into the rolls. I have had much worse sushi before, but I was hoping for a bit more for Las Vegas dining. Next time, I will take a friends suggestion and try some off-the-strip sushi locations."
"1","We stayed at the Pointe Hotel on a stacation and tried unsuccessfully to get reservations at A Different Point of View, so ended up here.\nWhat a disappointment. I had the Trout and, my mistake, asked for it to be saut\u00e9ed, it was overlooked and tasted of butter. The potatoes and all the other veggies that came with it were so buttered that this was all you could taste. Head Office had the Salmon which she said was fine.\nThe reason we had fish was because there was absolutely nothing on the menu that was Veggie, though our overthetop waiter did offer to make something up from another dish. Overall, a bad experience and I had been there before many years ago and also to the one at the South Mountain point and was not disappointed."
"5","Because bowling shoes ARE dancing shoes!\nIt's always tough reviewing concert venues because the actual show is such a major factor. Seriously, Kenny G anywhere (or Kenny Loggins or Kenny Chesney ... pretty much any Kenny) is going to suck. Elvis Costello & The Roots, on the other hand, can make any joint your favorite place on Earth for a night. \nThe beauty of Brooklyn Bowl is that it's got its own perfect game going. The people running and staffing BB are a separate class of awesome. (In particular, Adrees Ali earned the title of Grand Protector and Redeemer.) They took us in, made sure we had everything we needed, and sent us home feeling like we'd just found the one true oasis in the desert. \nI confess that I mostly hate Vegas. BB understands that not everyone wants to wallow in the desperate skank that floods every casino and most every corner of the strip. They've found the right blend of food, drink, music, and atmosphere and, naturally, added bowling! It works brilliantly. Even without the tasty grub and ten-pin hijinks, it's a great venue. The sound is excellent, and no matter where you are--from floor to balcony to the bowling deck--you have clear sight lines. The size is ideal (just under 2,000 capacity), and you can tell that the musicians feel the intimacy of it as well. The whole affair is also a screaming good deal. \nIf your show starts at 9:00, grab a lane at 7:00. After that, you're taken care of. It's a kind of magic Copperfield can't touch."
"2","As someone from the Philly area, driving by had me pretty excited. Pop's looks like Pat's! However, I got a cheesteak, with whiz, onions, and peppers- but they forgot the flavor.  Everything about it was bland.  I couldn't differentiate between the meat and the onions. It was weird. And the bread was awful- it was soft and did not taste like an Amoroso. Looks were most definitely deceiving. That said, the patio is great! And so were the sweet potato fries."
"4","This is the perfect late night substitute for Denny's or IHOP after an evening of the Vegas life. The portions are enormous and the food tastes good... even sober. \n\nI had breakfast, go figure. It was the Peppermill Omelet that consisted of a cholesterol bursting amount of eggs along with hash browns and a blueberry muffin. The omelet was as good as anything at a breakfast place. The muffin was very fresh. \n\nI can't tell whether this place is from the Hobbit or a vintage 70's slutty diner. It doesn't matter though because the waitresses fit right in, Vegas style. It's worth going back."
"2","The concept of Ramen is very simple and quite delightful. You get \""there\"", order your Ramen, and eat your Ramen. In Japan, the concept is cool because usually you order and pay through a machine (like an ATM) and everything is done rapidly and orderly. \n\nThus, my surprise at the complete lack of service of Ramen-Ya. Ordering a Ramen soup took nearly 20 minutes. \n\nThe Noodle is the key to a good Ramen soup, Broth being the second ingredient. I would've expected something quite good coming out of Ramen-Ya but unfortunately the noodles were plain and tasteless. Poor texture, no spring to them and difficult to noisily suck \""in\"". \n\nThe Broth was good however, a mix of miso and chicken fond. Enough taste to finish and not too salty to require additional water. \n\nThe fillings (porc slabs and vegies) were poor in taste and quantity, making the overall Ramen experience a  big mEh. At least the egg wasn't overcooked. \n\nTook the better part of an hour to eat a simple Ramen. After which, being still hungry, we asked for the menu, but were unable to re-order ( we got forgotten i suppose...). So we forgot to tip in return. \n\nSad to see this place so busy with the hispter vibe of the plateau, but fail at the simpliest of task. They seemed very busy with their takeout orders tho..."
