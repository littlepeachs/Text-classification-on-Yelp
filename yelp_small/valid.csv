"5","i love this place!!! their drink is awsome!!!\nwhen i camein, they always know what i want\nabout the service, they are pretty nice to me:)\nsometime they got busy, i will excusedf\nwhy people complain a lot? \nif u don't like this place just don't go there then."
"5","Given the only thing I've gotten here is various types of ice creams, this place is amazing. The service rocks and the prices are reasonable, while the atmosphere screams cozy coffeehouse. The T-shirts are pretty cool too, I love nothing more than to stop by here and get a desert after I get dinner at Boudreaux down the street :) Very nice and cozy."
"4","Muuuuuch better than Sbux. I really enjoy this place every time!"
"2","Hahaha ha ha.  What a shithole.\n\nYep, like everyone else, we stayed here on a last-minute package vacation deal cuz it was cheap as hell.  I doubt anyone comes here because they actually choose to.  You think, whatever, I can gamble in another casino, or spend all my time in nicer casinos.  And that's exactly what you do.  Except there's a few things that are kind of annoying about staying in a shitty hotel/casino and spending all your time in nicer places, like having to return to your shitty hotel/casino in the middle of the night.  And having to wake up there and go down to your shitty pool.  And having no convieniently-located dining options except for shitty restaurants.  \n\nThe staff was ok.  No one was rude, surprisingly - people were actually pretty friendly and jolly overall, said hi and how are you whenever we walked past.  Except for the security guard who told me to put my flip-flops back on my swollen and blistered feet was I was walking to my room.  Harumph.  They had no problem with me walking barefoot through the Bellagio or the Venetian - one of the managers at the Bellagio laughed when he saw me do it and said \""Good idea!\""  Stupid Riviera.\n\nRoom was ok.  Clean, average.  Air conditioner was kind of noisy.\n\nCasino sucks, and is depressing.  Cocktail waitresses are scarce, and when they do take your order, take a goddamn eon to deliver it.  And god help you if you don't tip every single time - you'll get a nice dose of baditude and some audible snide comments.  Barely any tables open, even on Saturday night.\n\nPool is lame.  Deep enough to dive into, but that's about the only good part.  Reminds me of a Best Western or Motel 6 pool.  Not cool.\n\nRestaurants are not only lame, but downright laughable.  With all the amazing dining options in Vegas, they expect people to be stupid enough to eat at a putrid-looking Asian restaurant that serves California rolls in bento boxes along with chow mein and kung pao chicken, or an Italian restaurant so creatively entitled \""Ristorante Italiano\"".  Yeah, you gotta be f'n kidding me.\n\nAll in all, if you have really, really low expectations, don't mind walking about 20 minutes to get somewhere nice, and this isn't your first Vegas trip (unlike my bf, unfortunately) then go ahead and stay here, and don't eat at any of the restaurants."
"4","This is one of our staple restaurants. There isn't usually a wait, but it does get busy and lively. We haven't tried the hibachi yet, but are looking forward to it. \n\nThe miso soup is good, and because I'm pregnant I haven't tried too much sushi. I did get a tempura shrimp roll once and was disappointed that the batter was soggy instead of crunchy. However, I recently had the shrimp tempura entree, and it was dynamite, so they clearly can make a mean tempura if they want. The tempura dipping sauce was a little bland. Many of their sushi specialty rolls tend to be on the hot side rather than sweet. I usually don't eat California rolls, but my husband did the other day, and it was the best CA roll I've ever had. It left me scratching my head wondering how a CA roll could be so good.\n\nTheir teriyaki is pretty good. Sometimes the chicken is dry, but the New York steak is consistently good, and tender for NY. They reportedly make their own teriyaki sauce, and do not use MSG, huge plus.\n\nAs for sides, their rice can be inconsistent, but their salads have good dressing and are pretty darn good for iceberg lettuce.\n\nThe service is decent, but there are some new servers who do things like put the food on the middle or end of the table instead of in front of the person who ordered it. Usually not a biggie, unless its hot soup they put in front of a young child...\n\nThat aside, it's one of our favorite \""regular\"" places."
"1","SO DISSATISFIED!!! Really have always enjoyed the buffet in the past, no shrimp, no crab, NOTHING but pizza for kids, no toaster for bagels, EXTREMELY SLOW SERVICE and a manager who doesn't care. You're better off going to a restaurant and ordering from the menu. Only two salads and a nasty brown fried rice. This USED to be AMAZING and now I'd just AVOID AT ALL COST!!!  I'M MAD AND FEEL RIPPED OFF!!!! \nStill love the hotel though."
"3","The only thing good about sushi shop is that if you go at closing time they give you free sushi boxes! Its not the best quality, but its cheap and on the go! There is not that many people here, since their is so many restaurants in proximity you never have to wait."
"5","This is my favorite Thai restaurant in all of Las Vegas! It's a tiny place with a constant stream of customers but I've never had a problem getting a table.\n\nSome of my favorite appetizers include: beef & chicken satay, stuffed chicken wings, and glass noodle salad.\n\nI'm not the biggest curry fan but I really enjoy their green curry.\n\nIf you have room in your belly for more food, you have got to try the pineapple fried rice! Enjoy!"
"4","Fantastic hole in the wall. Cozy ambiance and delicious food. Their fish tacos are amazing, burgers juicy, deviled eggs nicely presented, and pretzel bun are soft. Sausages with curry ketchup and cheese dip was tasty too. The waffles fries is also another fave. All in all, great first time experience."
"3","I'm sad because I went here with my family for restaurant week and my prime rib was a bit overcooked and my mashed potatoes were too salty~! Also, a few of my family members ordered the chicken pot pie & man was that loaded with salt as well.. Granted, chicken pot pies usually are salty, this was way beyond the amount of salt that should be added. Oh well, at least I was happy to enjoy some White Zin on the house, as a part of their restaurant week special. And their apple strudel dessert was delicious~!"
"1","I believe, the only reason why this place receives business is because people rather not wait for food at the ramen place across the plaza. Not great. The Thai tea is cheap but comes in a small styrofoam cup and filled half with ice. Also, if your group orders the Thai tea, some will have a good amount of milk and some will not. I chose the house seafood special with rice noodles. The soup was not spicy at all and the soup base made me feel sick. Everything is cheap, but that's all the quality food you get."
"5","This place is sooo super cute! Odorless so you don't have the acrylic smell and they do excellent work! I definitely recommend this place."
"4","Easily accessible, clean, some good rental agencies.\n\nUnfortunately, WE the renters have to pay for this.  High taxes + high fees per rental due to this new center that was built a few years ago.\n\nGet a $15 rental from Enterprise?  Try making that $10/tax+fee per day.  \n\nNickle and diming at it's finest due to the new center."
"3","Great for groups, and good enough to keep coming back."
"1","Save your money!! The food isn't bad but we spent way too much for the amount of food we got. We left hungry after ordering two entrees for the two of us. The pizza is paper thin crust and had a weird flavor. I haven't tried their gelato so maybe it's better. But go to little Cesar's over this place if you're hungry for pizza!!!!"
"2","There are dive bars and there are dive bars. This one seems to be in the middle of nowhere. It's easy to find if you're driving west on Russell; there's a huge sign on the side of the building facing you that says, \""The Hammer.\"" Driving eastbound, I totally missed it and had to turn around.\n\nWhen I walked in, the place was completely empty. The bartender and some other employee were shooting pool. I'm not sure what kind of crowd this place attracts, but they weren't there last night.\n\nThankfully, my cousins arrived shortly after. We had one round of drinks and left. The only reason we went there is because one of my cousins knows the bartender. She seemed cool at first, but got annoying after a while. There's a fine line between playfully jabbing and being abrasive. It may just be because she knows my cousin so well.\n\nIn any case, this place just isn't my bag... baby.\n\np.s. Obviously this place is NOT closed."
"2","I've order General Tso's chicken and disappointed. It wasn't sweet, tangy, or red enough and the sauce was too watery."
"1","Heavily disappointed when me and my friends went there for lunch. I got the distinct impression the food is pre-packaged when I asked if I could order the mushroom enchiladas a la carte. The waitress said it wasn't possible and that I would have to get the full plate. I  wanted to specify, so I asked if it was impossible to just  get a couple of enchiladas....and she said it comes with rice and beans.....Arghhh! What's the deal? But the food was good and she was on top of the refills. But then dessert came around! And so she regaled me with all their desserts and they all sounded good, so I chose the berry cobbler. She said it was her favorite and I was craving some healthy additions to a possibly decadent dessert! So there we waited....30 minutes for that freakin' cobbler! And guess what? No berries!!!! It was an apple cobbler!!!! Now that I think about it, I should have talked to the manager, but after waiting so long and keeping all my friends there, I felt like I was forced to eat it. So yeah, I'm not sure I want to go back anytime soon!!!"
"4","This was another team building activity I did for a group of conference attendees in Scottsdale.  This ended up being one of the more popular activity options.   I worked with Darin in the planning stages and he was always willing to accomodate my requests.  We ended up having the entire place to ourselves.  Everyone had free racing to start with and my staff member called me to say that everyone was having so much fun she didn't think she was going to get them off the track for the actual team building portions. \n\nFor the team building, we had them do a Pit Crew Challenge and a segway race.  The only negative feed back from the group was that having everyone participate in the segway race made it too long (there were about 45 people).  \n\nI wish I would have been able to join the group and try the karts but I guess I will have to go on my own time.  I would definetely use F1 again for another corporate event."
"1","This is the worst location in Vegas. They always screw up my order, the staff is rude, and the owner actually TRIES to get in arguments with you about his Multi-level marketing business. The owner is a douche and his staff is just as bad."
"5","Today.....this is my second time in today....I had granny apple with caramel sauce. Incredible!!!"
"2","When I go out for Mexican, I expect flavor.  That being said, Fiesta Ranchero was not what I expected.  Maybe my first mistake was ordering the Speedy Gonzalez combo, which was a couple tacos and an enchilada (or something like that).  Or maybe it wasn't my fault. Everything on the plate, including the rice and beans, was pretty underwhelming.\nI probably won't go back while there are still better Mexican places near campus (El Charro, Cocina Real, Fiesta Cafe).\n\nI'll give this place two stars because the service and the chips and salsa were good.  Also, it was fairly priced."
"2","Dimn lighting and large windows with a great view of the strip adds to the warm ambiance, but the loud music that was being played was out of place. I would have preferred classical or at least Italian music vs what was played which was modern pop and r&b music. Their motto was 'eat a little bit of everything, and not to much of anything' which probably explains why the portions were extremely tiny. I ordered the salmon which was delicious BUT was still hungry afterwards. The waiter had told us that the desserts were share-able -so my boyfriend and i ordered a Lemon bunt cake to share- but we were surprised to see a tiny sliver of cake that we ate with literally 3 bites -and that was around $13. \nOn top of that, the waiter spilled our cream (for coffee) and never cleaned it up, and broke a few glasses while walking around our table. \nIt was extremely over priced for the amount you receive (one cup/coffee was $6-and refills are NOT free).\nIt was a shame that we couldn't decide what to tip our horrible waiter; a charge of $61 was added to our bill of over $400 for his tip!\n\nover priced, tiny portions and horrible service But ambiance and the view were beautiful."
"4","Went here for our anniversary. Was not a big fan of the hostess but not a big deal. Our server was super friendly and the food was great. I got the petite filet and tr flavor was great. Their house sauce was amazing. My boyfriend had the Ny steak that was also really good. The server recommended a great wine to go along with our steak. We had the spinach and au gratin for the sides. I really like how the spinach was cooked. The desert was just okay. Something you could get at any casual restaurant. Nothing too special"
"1","TERRIBLE service, went here for breakfast and was in shock and awe at how bad our server was.  It took well over 45 minutes for us to get our food and there was only 1 other table in the restaurant.  I got our own coffee, drinks, half and half, ketchup and jam.  I will NEVER go back there again!"
"2","My once favorite lunch/brunch/dinner spot is gone!!\n\nBeware!!  The menu has changed drastically.  Once inspired with interesting Mexican/Southwestern items, it has been slammed into an American hodge-podge, leading me to believe the chef has changed or the owner drastically cut his pay.\n\nService has become ho-hum, although our server has been there a long time.\n\nReally too bad..."
"4","My memorable hotel experience entails a certain penthouse suite in this hotel several yrs ago. We were treated to some serious VIP treatment since things were being comped. We had a 3 bedroom suite, living room, limo service, show tickets, the whole nine yards. It was definitely a fun time and not forgetting the James Bond themed party on New Year's eve. \n\nThe lion's den is worth a visit as well!"
"1","Beware!!!! This place is a disaster!!!! I have NEVER rated ANYTHING a 1 star before in my life! Worst nail experience in my life! I can't stress how bad of a job Holly( the nail tech) did on my hand. I went in for a full set with my best friend that was visiting town and I did some research and found this \"" adorable\"" little nail salon. I usually go to the nail bar in henderson because they do amazing 3d nails and designs by hand but they were booked for the weekend so I called Pink nails and asked if they do 3d nails and the receptionist said they can do anything I can bring a picture of off of google. I was extremely excited and looked online and found a cute picture or polka dots and stripes and was looking forward to my appointment and to show off vegas a little bit to my friend. We walked in and I showed Holly the picture of what I wanted and she immediately said she refused to do it. Her manager came over and told her just to do it. I sat down and she glued the nails on without doing my cuticles and made my fingers bleed. I kept my patience until it was time for her to paint them and she once again was being a HUGE B**** and refused to do polka dots. She said she will do glitter instead. Again I kept my patience and said \"" okay at this point I don't care what you do\"" she painted a layer of regular nail polish and claimed that it was Gel, but it clearly stated that it was not. I wanted to see how many lies she would continue to tell me before I spoke up. After she painted my nails with glitter she took the file and filed down my cuticle area causing it to look like I needed a fill!!!! At this point I spoke up and had enough! She was giving me a very bad attitude and in the end I paid $70 and my blood is still boiling! 4 days later ( today) I went and paid the Nail Bar in henderson to fix their mistake and ended up paying another $60. They couldn't believe someone could charge me so much for the crappy job they did. P.s- they confirmed that the polish that Holly said was Gel... WAS NOT GEL!!! Don't let them scam you!!"
"3","My parents ordered from here. Pizza wings 2 liter coupon, and a steak sub. Delivery time wasn't too long. Pizza was thin. Little sauce and was cooked lite. Not to bad. Wasn't great but I had worse before. Wings were kinda small but tasted ok. Ranch was good. Steak was ok too. Fries were ok but fries on delivery don't stay fresh. Can't help that. They use some kind of cheap ketchup. In my family anything but Heinz just isn't ketchup. Overall not too bad but not great either."
"4","If you haven't been to the Cornish Pasty (pronounced past-tee), you have not really seen the heart of Tempe. It's a little place, not really good for groups or kiddos, but when you enter you truly fee the atmosphere shift, and guess what? Now you're part of the cool crowd. The food is so good! I love their mushy peas for a starter (although half of the time they are out) and then the Pilgrim to seal the deal. It's like a Thanksgiving party in your mouth any time of the year! All of their food is great, and this place is always busy it seems. Don't come on a Friday or Saturday night unless you like being in small spaces with a million loud drunks. Mid-afternoon is the best. The servers are usually pleasant, but some have a better-than-you hipster attitude. But hey, if you haven't been here yet, you're missing out on Tempe's best kept secret!"
"5","This review isn't necessarily for the food...we've always found it consistent, and we keep ordering it, so we obviously enjoy it.  \n\nThis is mainly for the manager, Robin.  Last week, we had a problem with a delivery, and when I called to speak to someone about it, he took care of it immediately.  As well as taking care of me this week.  This is first-rate customer service.  We are good customers (especially during football season), and will continue to be.  \n\nThank you, again!  By the way, everything was as delicious as it always is."
"2","Ehhhh I don't know about this. I was excited to have a new pizza place very close to my house, and that serves slices no less! So after a night out with some friends, the husband and I came here to get a couple late night slices. We arrived at the (very cute) pizza place sometime around 9, so not too long after they opened and ordered 3 slices, cheese, pepperoni, and a special (which was a white pizza with asparagus, bacon, and a few other toppings). It smelled good as we took it home. Unfortunately, the slices seemed old, like they'd already been sitting out a lot longer than they possibly could have if they had been made when the store opened. The crust was dry and stiff. The special pizza was especially bad, with a very flavorless white base atop the stiff cardboard like crust... it was not awesome. The cheese was significantly better since their sauce was alright, but still nothing amazing. Maybe their full pies are better (and more fresh), but I don't know that I'd come here for slices again."
"5","Great flavors and toppings. You can even get a waffle cone. I'll be back for the blackberry flavor alone."
"5","This place kicks ass! There are a lot of hidden gems throughout Las Vegas that serve great food off-the-strip. This is one of my favorites.\n\nAlthough it's AYCE, you order a la carte instead of going down a buffet line. The price is reasonable and the selection is very large.\n\nOne of the best deals in Vegas. \n\nGetting there from the strip: If you don't want to pay for a tax, get on the Gold Coast shuttle from Bally's to Gold Coast. The restaurant is  a 1/3 mile walk down W Flamingo."
"2","I don't get why LC likes coming here. I have to admit, I was looking out for her and Brody :)\n\nThis place blows. Nothing but tables. No room to dance. The makeshift dancefloor on the first floor is actually a narrow walkway. Weak. Music was OK.\n\nAt least I didn't have to pay to get in and our wristbands got us free drinks till 12."
"5","With all the awesomely themed hotels located in LV it's great to think that someone can still come up with something (fairly recently) that stands out as a unique and entertaining icon...\n\nWatching this simple yet enjoyable fountain show while listening to \""Time to Say Goodbye\"" played over the loud speakers really helps add to the Vegas experience and serves to help solidify that you've arrived!\n\nThe Bellagio offers this great fountain show during the daylight, but also when it is dark at night time, but I find it more enjoyable at night when the lights of the fountains serve as a way to enhance the experience.\n\nStrategically placed fountains in a large man made lake shoot fountains of water high into the air and through the magic of computers and imagination the synched fountains seem to dance along with the music played. Sheer beauty ensues!\n\nNot a whole lot is free in Vegas (understandable,) but this one is totally free and so worth checking out!"
"5","Sheer ecstatic bliss is what this place should be called! wonderful talented friendly hairdressers!  My friend and I went there for the first time today, let them cut our follicle fillers as they saw fit, and have never been more satisfied in our short little lives.\n\nIf you want bumpin' style and sexy looks, HIT IT UP!!!!"
"4","If you are looking for a place to just chill, then mandalay bay is the place. My boyfriend and i of course wanted to eat at nice restaurants, go clubbing at night, and shop in the day time, but our main goal was to chill and have fun. Since this was only my second time going to Vegas, I was asking around my vegas vets for suggestions and almost all said not to stay here because it's at the far end of the strip, which is it, BUT it really didn't bother us. I'm so glad I stuck to my gut instinct and chose here. We had the best view of the strip from our room, and the best sleep ever.\n\nI stayed at the Palazzo the last time, and it's amazing. the rooms are big, i guess i shouldn't get too deep into this, but i didn't think the pool was all that great. it's a glorified bath tub. and really, who stays in the room all that much? so who cares.... but mandalay bay, the rooms are pretty nice, spacious bathroom, and the best pool ever. it's not a pool! it's a beach! there's a wave pool... oh man, so great. we LOOOVED it. I suggest bringing your own inner tube, and a water camera :D\n\nand if you stay here, you need to order the animal burger at the beach. AND make sure to bring your ID. we were dumb, we thought that we'd avoid the trouble of bringing our wallets, so we just brought our room cards like some of the reviews said... and forgot our IDs!! so i didn't get my strawberry daiquiri from the waitress :("
"1","We went here for lunch on a Saturday and had a horrible experience. There was some kind of school band demo going on which would have been fine except it was unnecessarily and extremely loud!\n\nWe seated ourselves and didn't even get acknowledged for at least ten minutes. We finally got drinks and menus and another ten minutes passed without anyone coming to take our order. And the problem wasn't that they were busy as 95% of the tables were empty. And there were waitresses there but none seemed to be serving customers. While we were there waiting at least three other parties got up and left which is what we finally did as well. \n\nToby Keith should ashamed to have his name on this place!"
"1","I work around the corner and go here sometimes for a quick lunch. I've never had a problem here until today. I walk in, order my flat bread, sit down and BAM! In my sandwich is a HUGE grasshopper just jammed in there with the head popping out! I didn't freak out outwardly just calmly walked over to the cashier and showed her my sandwich. She joked that it's just a \""little extra protein\"" but would make me a new sandwich. News flash...this is AMERICA, nobody wants to eat that kind of \""protein\"" at Subway! My stomach is still hurting from the sight and for my trouble was offered \""2 free cookies\"". Great, thanks. All in all, I will never come back and probably would never eat at Subway again!"
"2","Meh is the correct. We went here because we saw all the signs for the seafood and whatnot. UGH. Wrong choice there. First let me start with the fact that the entrance to buffet is also right next to the entrances for the bathrooms. Lovely smell there. The hostess was nice. The server...well she pretty much ignored us until I actually had to flag her down to re-fill our water. The food...you get what you pay for. The \""seafood\"" that was on all the signs consisted of just shrimp. I could not find these Crab Legs everyone is talking about. Also the shrimp was DIRTY!!! Like DIrty!!! Like they hadn't been de-vained right. My boyfriend and I decided to stick to the fried foods just to be safe. I mean....it pretty much reminded me of like a Hometown Buffet or something. Not what you would except to find in Vegas. We tried it. We didn't like it. We won't be back."
"3","I was stressed out at the beginning of my wait at the airport and all I wanted was a Bloody Mary. Luckily I hatched that thought right outside of Home Turf Sports Bar which advertised \""mile high bloody mary's\"". As I walked in I found it to be messy and confusing. It's really unclear as to whether you should sit down and be waited on or go to the bar and order. This fact is exacerbated by the fact that they have a standing room only bar 5 feet from the bar they serve alcohol at which makes it hard to tell if there's a line or just people chilling. \n  Aside from that I got a double Bloody Mary for 10 bucks, not too bad for an airport, but it definitely wasn't a mile high or anything that should be boasting awesomeness. I could have made just as good of one at home. Honestly. That being said... I was glad to have my drink and a place to rest my hat for a bit. Definitely 3 star worthy."
"2","This place is just ok. Food is mediocre and service is horrible. Why do they keep the mean old man behind the counter? He must either own the place or is related to someone that owns it because I can't imagine why someone would keep him employed. Lol. He's really rude-amazingly rude. Enough to drive me away."
"1","the place looks great, and i would go there again to have drinks. But i would never eat there food again!!!!!!! no flavor, my wife had the filet it was over cooked and the sauce taste like it came from a powder form. our server had no clue what she was doing and the chef came over to talk to us and it was clear he was drunk or on something. But they had good drinks!!"
"5","Dr. Lemone's office is beautiful, clean, and state of the art. \n\nMy appointment was right on time, and I did not have to wait. I can't tell you how many dentists I've been to where I've made an appointment and had to wait an hour + just to get a simple teeth cleaning. \n\nThe dental hygienist was very friendly, professional, and gentle with my teeth cleaning. She was great at making conversation and giving you her undivided attention. \n\nDr. Lemone was also very friendly and straight forward. I do have to go back and get a crown, but he didn't try to sell me on anything I didn't need or make the situation sound more urgent than it actually is. \n\nOverall, I had a great experience here. It was a relief to finally fine a nice calm atmosphere in which to get my teeth treated. Great place to go for those of you that have a fear of dentists."
"3","I was impressed with Takumi. Their miso soup is delish. I had the veggie cucumber and avacado rolls. Will go back again"
"3","Great drive through mexican food. Rivals Robertos in San Diego. Nuff said!"
"4","A lot of the reviews here have already given a lot of detail about the airport, so I won't bore you with that -- but I would like to clarify that this airport is MIA (that's Miami) but is LAS. So, there you go. \n\nI like this airport. I've never had a problem with the TSA guys there, the lines have always moved quickly, and the airport is well-signed so you don't get lost. The Starbucks at the pickup area is always full, so they move pretty quickly there, too. \n\nParking has been fixed up a little where you no longer have to insert coinage. Now you get just a printed ticket that you present at the gate to pay. I paid $2.00 for about an hour while I waited for my brother, which seemed reasonable to me. \n\nAll in all, LAS is a cool airport!"
"1","The fish fry tastes like nothing from the east coast, the fish was inedible for 13.00? \nNot crisp, soggy & greasy as hell. Cole slaw was sub par. Tartar sauce is s*it. \nI really wish it was better, because, just once I'd like a good fish fry like back home. It's clean, like a clean bar. Without the booze. I won't be going back :("
"3","I like the bean dip. The salsa was decent.\n\nI had the Chile Colorado burrito, chimichanga style.\n\nDelicious.\n\nI went with friends. It's not really my neighborhood, but if invited, I would return."
"1","One of the worst experiences in Vegas restaurants.....   =(\n\nThe food tasted fine.... but if the burgers were going to cost me $15-$20, I expect excellent service. This is one burger joint I will never go back.\n\nThe Mirage hotel needs to do something about this place since the restaurant is in their hotel property and giving them a lousy name.\n\nP.S. I had to answer \""No\"" to the additional tips section question about Waiter service on Yelp, since they had waiters but there was no service!"
"5","Love this hotel- decor is beautiful, staff is top notch....drinks are great and the crowd is the Vegas crowd I like...they know how to dress, act and enjoy with out making fools of themselves...my kind of place!"
"5","Nothing but awesome customer service! Mike is the man! Check them out & they'll hook you and your car up right!"
"3","I've been here a couple of times.  Each time, I've had difficulty ordering because it is just so confusing.  It's kind of like Chipotle but they have a ton more options and it's not quite clear what those options are.  I think you just have to lean against the glass and grunt, \""I want that.\""  Very stoner.\n\nI've tried the chicken tostada bowl, chronic fries, a battered shrimp taco, and a carne asada taco.  The chicken tostada was ok but it came with a pathetic amount of sour cream and they left off the guacamole I ordered.  But I don't think they charged me for it, either.  The chronic fries, basically covered in everything including salsa, were pretty damn good though.  For whatever reason, these are advertised on their website, but are not on the menu.\n\nThe carne asada seems to be their claim to fame, but I didn't like it.  Too salty.  Then again, I got the very last bit of carne asada.  They were out by 6pm.  So maybe I didn't get the best representation of this dish, being the last little bit they had and all.  Also, he asked me if I wanted it baja style.  I said sure and that was a big mistake.  Mayo, cabbage.... doesn't really work with carne asada for me.  However, the shrimp taco baja style = excellent.\n\nThey have Dos Equis and Blue Moon on tap - $3 a pint.  The bar was completely empty.  I'm not sure if it is worth it for this place to have a liquor license.\n\nI'm willing to try this place again and maybe get some booze.  But I need to have a heart to heart with the staff and get the low down on the menu."
"1","This hotel is horrible!! The customer service has to be as old as the hotel because they have no understanding of what is like to treat a customer correctly! The front desk has attitude, the valet are airheads and the overall atmosphere just sucks! I regret ever staying here and would like to advice anyone on thinking about staying here to STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!! Rooms are small bathtubs have roaches, paint is chipping off the walls.... Ugh just a bad experience! I paid 178 for one night and regret it! I've stayed at motel 6 that are way better than this!"
"3","This is a nice mall but no matter where you park, you have to walk forever to get anywhere. In fact, you walk and walk and walk, period.\n\nI much prefer the Biltmore for all of my shopping needs."
"3","I love Anthro! The staff here isn't what I would expect for an Anthro store though. No one says hi when you come in. They do stare at you. No one asks if you need help or if you're ok either. Maybe they're just use to the store being empty, I don't know. I only stop in when I'm on the strip or can't find it at the Henderson location."
"5","Food is really good. Their country fried steak is really good especially the mash potatoe"
"3","Someone from work always brings in a dozen donuts from Dee's Donuts in Centennial, which we like. So when I saw that there was a Dee's in the same shopping center that Mac Shack is in I told my daughter let's get our dessert there after we eat.....\nWell, sadly by the time we entered there weren't many donuts to choose from. So we just got some glazed donut holes and a few strawberry donuts. Both were good, I like that there are real strawberry bits in the strawberry glaze on the donut. I remember liking the chocolate cake donut as well...."
"3","A little higher priced than I expected for such a divey place, but the food was great and definitely hit the spot. I got a chance to try the breakfast enchiladas with eggs on top of them and there were perfect! Something about the yolk and the enchilada sauce really won me over. I also tried the green chili and shredded beef burrito. It was really good and filled with authentic flavors.Lastly, there were the chips. They were about average for chips here in the valley, but I really liked the salsa verde...I kinda couldn't stop eating it. \n\nI'm excited to go back to this place and ask for a recommendation. I have a feeling that I will find something here that will keep me coming back again and again."
"2","I too was lured in by the tasty sample, however I was never told that I could buy single cup of tea to go and drink, I would have liked to do that at least. \nI was instead told that minimum tea purchase was 2.oz. and the tea that I was interested in would have cost me around $20! \nNO THANKS. \n\nI don't need that much tea and seriously am not going to save soggy leaves to re-steep another time. \n\nI would have liked to buy just enough for a few glasses of tea. \n\nSorry Teavana I will be going elsewhere."
"5","I love meee some thriftyssss!:D"
"4","Ok - Buddy suggested this place and I was a bit skeptical when he was raving about the cheese curds...  Basically wrote the place off as a typical, hick Wisco dive.\n\nBut I was wrong.  Great place.  Had the perch fish fry on a WESNESDAY.  Breaking the Wisconsin Friday night fish fry was a nice change of pace.  We also got the fried cheese curds as an app and they were pretty darn good.  You get you choice of dipping sauces.\n\nIt is also located right across the street from the capitol, which was pretty cool.  We got to see a couple hundred protesters against Walkers bill.\n\nAlso - had to try my first Old Fashioned... not a big fan.\n\nWaitress recommended the mac and cheese + the old fashioned burger too... we caught a glimpse of these going to other tables - FOOD ENVY!\n\nI'd definitely go back!"
"5","5+ stars!\n\nThe Container Park was such an awesome place to visit and quite honestly, one the highlights of my trip to Las Vegas. \n\nThe area was still relatively new and we found it really quiet on an early Thursday afternoon. So we took advantage of the ample lawn space and practiced our handstands and cartwheels, hung off the ladders of the caboose, visited the barber, ate some jerky, lazed on the swinging bench, and watched some kids tag the brick wall with some chalk. All while the sun loomed high with nary a cloud in the sky.\n\nThe centerpiece was a tempting treehouse that was off limits because the scorching heat had turned it into a huge vertical frying pan. We entertained ourselves with the NEOS play system where we tuckered ourselves out with light-tagging challenges that sent us in cardio circles. Running under unrelenting heat rays sent us panting to the shade where we constructed a giant-sized Jenga set with the foam blocks. A nearby curious child joined our game and with his father's help, he managed a few key plays.   Another friend fashioned herself a couch complete with a drink kozzie and sat back chanting, \""Jenga...Jenga...Jenga...\""  What goes up must come down and down the tower tumbled at eight levels high, raining cushy blue rectangles to a chorus of mirth and merriment.\n\nIntrigued by tales of the past-9 PM wonder hour, I will surely return the next time I am in the hood."
"4","My two stops in Vegas every year during the big Real Estate Convention are Nobu at the Hard Rock and Roy's here on Flamingo. Although I live just 15 minutes away from Roy's Anaheim, it seems I've been to this Vegas locale more often. And after learning that my old college roommate is the brother-in-law of chef partner Percy Oani, this is prolly a biased review! But again, I've been coming here every year, so this really should be a realistic review, so scratch that!\n\nService here has always been impeccable and friendly. From the minute you step into the restuarant you are greeted by a hostess, then transferred to your table, greeted by your server, waited on by bussers and checked up on by a supervising maitre d'. On special occassions they'll even have a couple of hostesses that greet you upon entering the restaurant only to 'lei' you! Yeah!\n\nSo after having the opportunity to meet chef partner Percy Oani, he totally did us up with the Shanghai Style \""Filipino\"" Lumpia and the Crispy Karaage Calamari. This was IN ADDITION to the edamame that comes with a garlic/peppers seasoning, and on the house, mind you! The lumpia comes cut like an order or sushi does, but was stuffed with lobster and topped with a sweet chili garlic shoyu (soy) sauce. Absolutely Solid. But it was the calamari, which I know you can get just about anywhere, that was over the top. This appetizer came with a yuzu aioli and pesto sauce that is TO DIE FOR... I don't like to put mayo on anything. EVER. But once you call it 'aioli,' I'll dip my fingers in the shiz and be lickin for days! And this yuzu aioli is one of those things I wanna bottle up and put on EVERYTHING!\n\nAfter our appetizers came a Mango & Papaya Salad, which was solid. And being at Roy's, I just always feel like I have to go with a fish for dinner, and we did - the Misoyaki Butterfish and the Teppan Grilled Island Ono. The Butterfish was reminiscent of a miso chilean sea bass I've had at a few other restaurants, but this fish seems to have a little more fat (always good!) and a little more oil. Yum! Although I did not try the Ono, that plate was licked clean as well!\n\nAnd finally, even after every appetizer was inhaled, salad and fish consumed, we still had to order dessert. Even though there was no more room, even after we loosened our belts, bring on the chocolate souffle and the upside down pineapple cake! Again, the plate licked clean!\n\nAnd once you think you've taken in the kindness of the restaurant and all it has to offer, our wonderful server Brittany, so kindly calls a taxi for us, just to remind us that not only are we getting an incredible meal here, but the service too, is just as incredible!"
"3","Pretty disappointed. After having such a fantastic first experience with Artie, he was the first person that I wanted to call when I needed a plumber. Yesterday, on 12/12/12, I called four times over the span of 6 hours and left 2 messages. the second message expressing the urgency of me needing him to call me back. \n\n6/2/13 - Edit. I haven't been on YELP for several months. Probably since the time of the original post. I did get a VM from Artie a couple days after the original message (By that time I had found another plumber so I didn't bother to call back). Further, I got a message here on Yelp explaining that he was really sick with a fever that day. When you are a small business owner, and worse, a one man shop, I can understand how you can never have sick days or days off. I still think Artie needs to find a way to respond in a timely manner, especially when I mentioned how urgent it was. \n\nI will revise my rating from 1 back to 3 since he did get back and explain to me the situation. I will still stand that my original experience with him was great."
"4","Two words: video roulette!"
"3","Ok - the food here looks good, the space is modern and inviting, but the burgers (what they're supposedly known for) are just okay. If you read my reviews on a regular basis, you know I'm a big burger fan, so take it from me. While Holsteins' burgers look mouthwatering, taste-wise, they are nothing special. I really wanted to love this place because I had awesome experiences at just about every other restaurant I tried in the Cosmopolitan Resort in Vegas, but this one just didn't do it for me. Luckily, the fries that were served with the burger were tasty... and, our friend Denise who was with us ordered a milkshake, which was tasty. Note that, like many Vegas restaurants, Holsteins is a little pricey--especially for burgers."
"5","This Red Robin is right down the street from my house and I am there on a monthly basis. The food is just like any other Red Robin really good but what really sets this location apart is the staff. I always get the best service no matter what waiter or waitress I get. The last time I was there one of the waitresses recognized us from a couple weeks before and made sure to come by and bring us a basket of fries and a large thing of ranch before our food came out. I have never had better service."
"3","Eldorado Casino's a quaint little joint located in the old part of Henderson.  I was a bit apprehensive because of how small the place is, but there really isn't a need to be.  They have quarter craps and the dining isn't too bad.  Honestly, I wouldn't have tried the place if my friend didn't work there.  The food at the cafe's descent.  Nothing was really bad especially for the price.  I just think there's nothing here though to spark my interest in coming back."
"4","In my opinion, it needs to be a bit more lively. Still though, this does everything you'd expect for a historic district. You'll find what is perhaps the highest quality AND quantity of antiques on one block. Housed in buildings that have stood much longer than you or I. In what has only recently become a booming metropolis, what is old is certainly rare. \n\nIt has some decent dining options. I feel the Subway is out of place, and needs to GTFO, but you've got one of the best pizza places in the state (La Piazza), one of the only places for German (Haus Murphy's), as well as a Lenny's. Let's not forget La Perla, which moonlights as a fun Latin nightclub. For coffee, you've got above average cafes in Mighty Cup and A Shot of Java, where you can catch tons of live, local music. \n\nBars do leave much to be desired, however. Perhaps they're discouraged by the local police precinct, but I think it could really shine if hip new locales like OTG Wine & Beer were open later. In the future, I think we'll see even better dining and drinking options, but for now this place is like an Oasis in a portion of desert with very few attractions. If only it were as good year round as it is in winter."
"5","Greasewood Flat is fantastic! Where else can you see Cowboys, Bikers and Tourists sitting outside together sharing huge picnic tables?\n\nThe food is simple but delicious, the beer is cold, the entertainment is first class and the atmosphere day or night is never boring.\n\nI have been here now about four or five times and loved it each time. It was only on my last visit that I finally got to meet the Rooster I have often heard and the Burros. Sunday afternoons is by far the best time to visit ..... a little before the sun goes down for people watching and then stay to watch all the fire pits lit up. If you are up to it there is also a dance floor.\n\nCAUTION: Do not wear open toe shoes .... boots are best ..... and it does get about 10 degrees cooler here being slightly elevated so bring a jacket. It is very dusty but that is part of the fun! : )"
"4","I'm a fan of Mark Rich's New York Pizza.  We usually get a 12\"" supreme style pizza with olives, pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms,  peppers, and onions.  Every meal I've had here has been delicious, service quick and friendly, and at a good price.  I'll not argue how \""authentic\"" to the New York style they are as I'm no expert however, I'm an expert in taste and I've enjoyed all the pizza I've had here!"
"4","Great cocktails, kick ass burgers, and world class people watching. The decor and setting in the civic center park make this a go to destination for anyone wanting to hang out in Old Town for an evening. The service can use a bit of cheering up but all in all I had a great experience."
"3","Another buffet.   Three stars (I graded it relative to other buffets)\n\nMy wife's first time in vegas-  so we were obligated to go to at least one buffet.\n\nWe did breakfast at Le Village.  The layout was really nice - it was a pleasant eating space.\n\nWhile probably better than the average buffet - this place a few hits - and a lot more misses. The crepes looked good - although i passed.  The desert pastries were pretty good.  The corned beef has was really good.  The bread was good also.\n\nScrambled eggs were more of a trainwreck than they usually are at a buffet.\n\nWhile it may have been naive of me to expect decent cheeses at a French themed buffet - the cheese was terrible.  It was flavorless.  Like jail food bad.\n\nSkip this place and go to Mon Ami Gabi for breakfast -also inside of Paris."
"3","I am not the biggest fan of pizza but decided to try it . The pizza was okay but I would prefer BJs"
"1","I felt horrible after eating my carne asada burrito here last time. Being in a gas station isn't what bothered me. For about $1.50 more chipotle is right across the street. Not worth it to me for what they charge for burritoes, especially compared to the nearby chipotle. Even the mcdonalds nearby is still doing business though, so I guess that needs to be considered too. Could be much better, and could be worse too I guess. Definitely better alternatives nearby with more reasonable pricing that serve higher quality food."
"4","Came here and was confused by the setup. Felt like we came in through a back door in someone's house. There was nice decoration but it felt a bit dirty inside. \n\nI ordered the chia seed drink and I loved it! The textures were fun and it tasted very sweet. It was something I had before as a child but I forgot all about it. It was very nostalgic for me. \n\nI also got the meat combination plate. It came out beautifully decorated. Each of the meats had a nice sweet caramelization without compromising the flavor of the meat. The blackened chicken was my favorite. It had so much juicy flavor that I couldn't help but to get down on it with my hands. \n\nOverall delicious food, smaller portions, moderate prices, low ambiance."
"5","The first thing I HAVE to say about this place is don't judge a book by its cover!  The outside of the restaurant and its location could lead one to believe that it was going to be disappointing inside (to be honest I only went because of the yelp reviews) and then I walked in and BAM! I was blown away.  It was so nicely decorated, it had a very rich/authentic feel to the place.  The staff was over the top friendly, the food was simply divine, and the Bellini (champagne and pureed berry) was off the chain!  \n\nMy friend and I had pot stickers and spring rolls for apptz - delicious and hot- quickly came out as well.  Main course for lunch for me was the Shrimp Chili Mint Noodles, it had so many good reviews, YUM YUM YUM. I had it on heat 8 (I have a spicy palate, but next time I'm going to 10, it was spicy but I wanted more) .  My friend had the Pad Thai and the only thing I can say about that is, I have never liked Pad Thai, I thought it was gross and hated that peanut flavor to it, this Pad Thai was so freaking good, I'm pretty sure I'm getting this next time, seriously! \n\nIf you are around this place, craving a little ethnic food in your life, and Thai sounds good, don't pass this place, you'll be crying like a baby caused you missed it!"
"1","Love Krispy Kreme  unfortunately Xavier has to be the worst customer service guy. No smile no customer service and when we asked a question he was impolite. No just fricken RUDE. Come in if Xavier is not here. Or not at. All. !!!!!!!!   \n\n\nXavier get a personality or go work in a mine where you don't have to engage people because you are not good at it at all ."
"3","This is a nice alternative to Ichiza.\n\nIt's not as slammed, the service is much more polite and friendly, it has an atmosphere that is quiet and pleasing, and you don't have to put up with the sour look from the owner of Ichiza.\n\nHowever, the food is not quite as good as Ichiza.\n\nIf you are with someone who doesn't really care for Sushi, or want to sit and impress on a date, this place is a good option."
"4","I love coming to sushi ichiban for their all-u-can-eat sushi special! At first, I was a bit suspect based on what others have told me and having eaten at places in chicago, but I was pleasantly surprised! They have a large variety of sushi from spider rolls to something called a spicy tuna pizza, which is a rice patty tempura with spice tuna and spicy mayo on top. They should really add to the appetizer portion of the all-u-can-eat menu though. The only thing that really irks me about this place is that they raised the prices by like $8 within a year! WHO DOES THAT!??! Thank the lord my friends have coupons so we were able to still get the deal for a decent price. Overall, the all-u-can-eat deal is good, but only if you have those coups, lol."
"1","Terrible service - slow, indifferent, inhospitable.  Mediocre food.  So many better places - don't waste your money."
"3","It's ok.  I love their soup.  The egg foo yung patties are terrible.  But they do have great sauce and fresh veggies.  The staff is nice.  I am just not blown away by the food."
"1","This place had over priced food that was very below average not to mention a Camara that is working and records in the men's room!! WTF drinks tasted very weak STAY AWAY"
"5","Sooo....have you ever been given a tablet pc as a wine list at a restaurant?  I have not.  So freakin' cool.  Normally you're given the generic binder type thing and depending on the thickness of it immediately form an opinion of what their wine selection must be.  Well....wow...you're given the tablet and told, \""Ok miss (or whatever), you can choose a wine by type, label, region, vintage, appellation, etc\"" so of course, I'm immediately overwhelmed.  I ask for the sommelier and because I'm treating (long story-it's Vegas), I ask for the last wine of the year acc. to Mr. Parker. (that's right...big spender-natch--ha!)  Boom!  There it is on the tablet pc/wine list thingie.  Funny (or curiously) enough, my friends had not heard of the famous wine tower with the famous wine angels, so I ask if he can tell us when they're getting our wine for us so we can watch our corresponding wine angel, so (very \""mission impossible-y\"") he presses a forefinger to his ear and says, \""Uh, Angela?  You got the brunello?  Great. Yeah, can you turn around and wave please?\"" She does.  How cool is that???  How many places can they do that in?  Not many.  Only at Aureole.  Only in Vegas, where Cirque de Soleil is the new Barnum & Bailey. Not only that, but the food is fabulous.  GREAT experience."
"3","its a good place to get hot fresh & decent chinese food"
"5","Delicious traditional Taiwanese food very home style food awesome tasty food and great service the place to eat home style cooking you must try"
"1","Well, I'm glad someone had a good experience here.  Mine was horrible.  I'm not complaining about the quality of workmanship because this was fine but the man running the place is HORRIBLE.\n\nI didn't have my red claim ticket because a friend had dropped of the purse for me.  However, I did have a receipt showing the purse had already been paid for and I pointed out the purse hanging on the wall and described exactly what it had been brought in for.  You'd think surely this would have been enough but, NOT so.  The manager flat out REFUSED to give me my purse even with the receipt.  I demanded my purse several times and then and only then, he relented--I was FURIOUS.\n\nI will NEVER do business here again even though the owner was very nice and apologetic when I called him at another store."
"4","Every trip to Vegas at least once a year we try to find a off the strip diner to have breakfast and always end up back here.  Generous portions, great coffee, friendly locals and reasonable prices.   I always get an omelet and pancakes, usually the biggest plate I've ever seen for a side....."
"2","I found the service to be severely lacking but really enjoyed the food. It's true when people say this is a \""second rate PF Chang's\"" because they are owned by the same company but the food is good at a lower price. \n\nYou order your food and then receive a number to take to your table for your food to be brought to you. I was with a group of about six or seven and our \""waitress\"" was either incredibly new or incredibly uninterested in learning the menu. She consistently brought each person the wrong meal they ordered. And then when she would bring the food out, she wasn't sure which meal was which. She couldn't tell the difference between a meal with chicken or tofu. It got to the point where the service was so comically bad, we thought it was all an elaborate joke. \n\nI would go back for take out orders but wouldn't want to deal with a similar hassle of dining-in like I experienced."
"3","Went here for all you can eat and thought it could have been much better.\n\nThe service was really slow.  We ordered 2 rolls at first and it took forever.  I think 2 other tables that come in after us had their food before we did.\n\nThe sushi was very sub-par.  I understand that it's $20 all you can eat but seriously...I guess you get what you pay for."
"1","the store and company does not care about customers that are unemployed.  They will not help with making arrangements to make\npayments every month.  They are awful."
"4","I had eaten here years ago. My family went again tonight because we had a Groupon. It was actually a great time. The waitress was VERY good- sorry I don't know her name. Shee was on my families refills. \n    The food was good- My husband had a calzone- He loved it. We had mozz sticks, maybe the best ones I've ever had. We had a 20 pc mild chicken wings. They were so far- my favorite milds. I'm picky because I can't take really hot stuff and these wings were tasty and good. Great size chicken too.\nWe had a pizza and it was ok. Not the best, Not even close to the worst. Nothing bad to say. I will go back for the wings:)"
"2","Overpriced? yes.\nQuick? no.\nWorth it? only if you are about to pass out.\n\nYou will have to wait at least 15 minutes for your coffee in the morning.  It will be quicker to walk to the nearest Starbucks.  There are 4 people taking orders, a line out the door, and only 1 person making drinks.  Bagels tastes like bla (yes, that is an actual culinary term) and the fruit  & yogurt parfait is a joke (on you).  \n\nIt is a cool concept for Vegas ('high-end' market and cafe in a hotel lobby); just very poorly executed.  I think the **** hit the fan for me on my second trip there (I was staying at the Vdara) when I was overcharged for an Amy's microwaveable frozen dinner.  Sticker says $5.50, register says $9.50.  Cashier did not bat an eyelash; looked shocked when I suggested I was overcharged.  Hmm. ... I wonder how many people have previously not noticed and simply written it off as another overpriced Vegas expenditure.  Regardless, this is unacceptable for a cafe/market at a luxury hotel. \n\nThe only redeeming thing about this place is the bear claw. I bet there's crack in it! (note that the preceding sentence is intended for comic relief and that the writer is not actually implying or suggesting that Vdata Market uses crack in their baked goods. maybe.) Possible other redeeming factor: they had a bottle of Riesling for sale for $11.50 on the market side. I did not try it though so the jury is still out. If anyone tries it, let me know how it is.\n\nSave your time. Save your money. Go somewhere else."
"3","When I walked in we were greeted instantly. The place smelled a bit like a hole in the wall but nevermind that. We were happy to come in to happy hour. Galbi for $11.95. Whoop! Thankfully we were the only people there because there was only one server. I ordered the galbi and parents ordered the bulgogi. They also ordered a mango and mocha boba. Ten minutes in more people trickled in. and then this is where the service started to get slow. We got our appetizer no problem. Then side dishes. Ten minutes later the entrees were ready. However, it took him 5 minutes to get our rice. \nAnother waitress showed up and we thought things would go smoother. We asked for our bobas and her response was \""he's by himself and working on it\"".  I didn't like this response considering we had already been there 20 minutes without any drinks we ordered. \n\nOverall we enjoyed the food but just not impressed with speed and service."
"4","Gotta love a women's spa that has beautiful prints of Johnny Depp and other gorgeous men on the wall! \n\nReversa did my 80 minute massage. It was great. For some reason, she sort of spent a lot of time on my left side of my body and I kept waiting for her to balance it out. But, her massage was great, thorough, and she was very quiet during my massage. I prefer quiet and not a lot of idle chatter. \n\nYou can tell she has been doing massage for 13 years. She really knows what she is doing. The spa has a sauna and a jacuzzin. A gym, too. You can use all of the faciliites all day long and come and go as you please. \n\nI will definitely go back next time I am in town."
"1","I was served dirty plates and the most awkward cup of green tea ever ( a plastic cup full of large leaves with a bit of hot water)...when I complained..of course no one spoke english. This place sucks.."
"4","Ajo Al's has been one of my favorite locals only places in the Valley. The food is great, the portions are large, and the atmosphere is homey. It's the kind of place that feels like if you started coming every week, people would know your name.\n\nMy two favorite dinners are both specialties: Mushroom Enchiladas Blancas and Pollo Blanco Enchilada. Both have their delicious white jalape\u00f1o sauce. \n\nWhile you are here, check out the bathrooms. Very nice!"
"5","The first Saturday of every month is PARENTS NIGHT OUT, from 6pm to 10pm. At $15 for 4 hours of babysitting, it's the best deal in town. \n\nWe had our son's birthday party here and he had a blast. Twice the # of children who we expected came, and since these places typically charge penalties for added children you can see how that would add up. These prices were established on their website, and our problem was with the inconsiderate parents who brought their entire families to play or did not RSVP, not with the establishment.  Since they have a limited and allotted time for each party, I didn't mind their methods of wrapping up the party. I didn't want to infringe on another party's time and I was aware of the time we had (2 hours TOTAL).\n\nI really like the owners, I appreciate them not being afraid to scold my child if he needs it. He is quite the handful and they've always been able to take care of him during parents night out. \n\nThey have a TV area if you decide to drop in and play. Take advantage of this place for date night and/or getting children activities in during our hot summers. Support our small businesses."
"2","I've only done take-out from this location and each time has been good.\nI've always constructed the Pick 3 which seems to be the best deal going on the menu.\nThe Chimi is good with Chorizo (Mexican Sausage), you cant beat the enchiladas, tacos are good and the chips n' salsa are great.\nThis place does offer outdoor seating; its not a very big patio, but looks like it could be fun on a nice weekend night.\nThe portions are plenty big and the service at the bar has always been great for pick up."
"5","The most amazing show. Great people, new innovative products, and vendors that are friendly. Clif bar throws cool parties. Customer service is wonderful. Terry is great she helped us get our gala tickets back even though we cancelled them by mistake. Give her a bonus!! All together great show for any retailer. Thanks guys!!"
"4","Sprouts is my number one go to store for all produce! The prices are always reasonable and the product is always in great shape. I gave it 4 instead of 5 because sometimes when I go the check out is very slow (I think it may be more the customers though)."
"5","I loved the food. Healthy and delicious."
"5","We bought two basic hybrid bikes from this place about a year ago, along with some accessories and a pump. They were helpful, no hard sell, and we could tell they were giving us what was good enough for our needs, not necessarily the most expensive we could afford. Have gone back in a few times to switch out some accessories and they have been extremely helpful. Even brought back our pump back in - more than 6 months after the original sale - to replace the head (it was plastic and had just broken) and they replaced it for free, said it should have lasted longer so they upgraded us to a metal head and even put it on for us. Very impressed with their professionalism, service and quality. If you're looking for a bike or accessories or service on your bike, you'll be well taken care of."
"2","My husband and I came this past Sunday (7/28/23) and called ahead.  We were told the wait would be an hour.  Cool, to be expected on a weekend.  Showed up 40 minutes later and checked in where we were told that it would be 10 more minutes.  45 minutes later and still no table.  Finally sat down and after being completely disappointed by their half- bite biscuits we ordered as an appetizer, we waited for our main course.  55 minutes later and still no food!  Finally our food came.  I asked for the manager to come to our table...surprised this wasn't done already.  Manager came by and stated rather abrasively, \""It's better to come on a week day.  There's always one table that gets lost in the mix of orders and unfortunately that was you guys today.\""  Really?! We were shocked!!!!  A grouchy manager was a definite way to ruin our Sunday.  Ugh.  Also very surprised to hear a mgr. admit that they consistently have a problem with losing and keeping track of food tickets.  Won't be chancing this place again. If the manager were more congenial, and possibly apologetic then maybe we could overlook the horribly inaccurate wait for our table and food.  Upsetting because this used to be our go-to spot for brunch and bringing our out of town family/friends."
"2","A visit to Portovino will remind you how easy it is to claim that you're something special, and how different it is to prove it.\n\nIf you've read my other reviews, you'll know I love my sushi grade tuna steaks. I enjoy going to a restaurant and trying their version, especially when the server tells me how good it is. \n\nPortovino's tuna steak, at $36, was actually 4 1.5\""x1.5\""x1\"" (approx.) cubes. Is that enough for a meal? Is that worth anywhere close to $36? Nah. Not even close. The pieces were nice, but the multi-coloured sesame seeds added nothing. In fact, they took away from the dish. I cut off the edges to eat them first (otherwise I would have starved) to leave just the tuna to finish my \""meal\"" - if you can call it that. The tuna was tasteless, which was an absolute shame. Surprisingly (and thankfully) the wasabi sauce that decorated the plate helped and was not as overpowering as I feared. The side mashed potatoes and vegetables (peppers and zucchini) were actually better prepared than the $36 fish. (shaking my head). Quite disappointing, especially considering that of the 5 of us at the table who ordered the tuna, no one was impressed - but that might be because I got the best looking tuna of all of them. One person got 5 pieces instead of my 4, but the 5th was a tiny, scrap end piece that should have been eaten by the chef instead of served.\n\nThe service was pleasant, thank you. \n\nThe minestrone soup was very tasty, and some in our party did enjoy their meals, despite various degrees of temperature accuracy. \n\nUnfortunately, one person ordered a $42 filet, medium rare. It was served well done (!!) with the rest of the dishes, and when she sent it back, it took 25 minutes (!!!!!) to come back rare, at best, but mostly raw. Unedible. \n\nWe joked at how pissed off Gordon Ramsay would have been, but the real joke is Portovino, but without the laughter. Pretentious and uninspired. I don't like these qualities in people, and I hate them in establishments that charge a fee for the \""privilege\"" of eating there. This visit was not my idea and I was not the host, and I guarantee I'll be choosing a different place when I do make the choice.\n\nIf I didn't reserve my 1-star ratings for those establishments that were shockingly bad, Portovino might qualify. However, kind Mark awards them 2 stars (but they are really small stars, and very expensive.)"
"3","My friends from North and South Carolina were craving for sushi so the seven of us decided to stop by Sushi Kim on our way to a business reception. This restaurant is Korean operated with a wide range of Korean and Japanese dishes to choose from. Although the location seemed desolate by the time we got there, the interior was spacious and festive with mini barbecue grills and bento boxes highly visible at every table. I was skeptical about the quality of either cuisine but in support of my friends I eventually chimed in with a 10-piece mixed nigiri with miso soup and mango sorbet for dessert ($41 w/tax and tip). \n\nAmong the nigiri sets, I thought the sake, ikura, and uni were decent but not fantastic or super fresh. The miso was too salty and the double scoops mango sorbet was generous but did not create a spark. With a versatile menu and spacious seating arrangements, this could be a decent place for large group gatherings. However, as someone who is spoiled rotten with fantastic Asian food from California, I thought the quality of sushi was rather bland for the price they were charging.\n\nIn short, this is how they measured up on a scale of 1-5 stars:\n\n1.) Quality and freshness: 3 stars, everything was decent but the wow factor was missing.\n2.) Creativity and presentation: 3 stars, the cuts of the fish were generous and nicely presented.\n3.) Quantity and substance: 2.5 stars, the flavors were weak, unimpressive but passable.\n4.) Accessibility and affordability: 2 stars, the price was very steep for the little amount of sushi I got.\n5.) Service and ambiance: 4 stars, our server was unresponsive at times but the ambiance was clean and festive.\n\nWith some reluctance, 3 stars for the overall experience. I won't be coming back."
"4","Love the coffee and the food menu!!!  I love this place and the atmosphere!  My only complaint would be that the tables are ALWAYS full with people doing some type of work.  I just think there should be an area that is for short term customers!"
"3","I went there for dinner and was seated at the sushi bar.  It didn't look busy but the teppanyaki grill was.  The chefs were quick and efficient.   The freshness of the fish was good.  I thought some stuff could have been better.  I would probably go again. dont recommend the uni though i think it was fresh too bitter."
"2","One of the worst Italian restaurants I've ever been to. \n\nFood is terrible. It's American Italian and its worse than olive gardens. Need I say more?\n\nService was really slow. Pasta was not cooked al dente and was flavorless. Why oh why. Such terrible food at an otherwise beautifully decorated restaurant."
"2","Let's meet at the Starbucks. Ok that sounded good since our friends didn't want to really eat breakfast and this was right inside Planet Hollywood where we were staying.\n\nI'm surprised that I keep finding surprises at Starbucks. You'd think I would've seen it all by now. But, no, this Starbucks came up with a few more for me. Like the fact that they don't sell the regular Starbucks coffee cake and the blueberry pound cake was just very so-so. \n\nAlso, the fact that a bottle of water here was $3.50!!! What! That must be the big one my husband said. No, it's the 8 oz. Crystal Geyser. The half liter (or whatever the big one was - who cares!) was $4.50. But, you could get a Frappucino here for $3.00 It was less than the price of any of the waters.\n\nWater is obviously a premium in this town where alcohol is a cheap commodity. So is a nice, quiet place to relax anywhere inside Planet Hollywood. So, the coffee was just ok. It's Starbucks after all."
"5","So peaceful. Beautiful decor and calming environment. Felisha had me so relaxed that I was asleep during my facial. I came in because of a gift card from my son and his girlfriend, but I will be back! Very reasonably priced. The products used had a lovely fragrance and I have very sensitive skin, but had no problems with their line. My skin is glowing! Thanks for the treat!"
"4","My grandparents wanted something mexican for dinner and they did not let them down!\nWe arrived on a Saturday around 6:30 definitely busy, the wait was 30-45 min. We put our names on the list and waited outside as the lobby is not large enough to hold many. We counted i believe 4 seats... with elderly this is hard to stand that long. \nWe soon realized that they did not come outside to call any names, thus having to stand in an overcrowded lobby to wait for our names to be called. Luckily a younger couple gave up the seats to my grandparents. \nThe wait was not too bad. Once seated we could tell they were definitely busy. Chips and salsa were at the table before we were even greeted by our server. AWESOME!\nThe server was definitely overwhelmed but seemed to handle it pretty well. Food took a little while to get but the chips and salsa definitely held you over. \nThe chicken and beef unfortunately weren't very flavorful like we had hoped. Even tho the menu described the chicken to have spices it tasted boiled and plain. :(\n\nHowever the rest of the meal was delicious and it made the grandparents happy to try somewhere else that was for the most part authentic.\nIn the end we will be back to try it out again, maybe next time reservations?? or not on a Saturday!"
"2","Takes \""sprawl\"" to a whole new level.  By the time we walked all the way to our \""in terminal\"" rental car, I had lost 5 pounds."
"3","After a private party at Commonwealth, my best friend and I decided to come down to BWW for some grub to soak up the alcohol.  This location is open all night and centrally located in the same parking lot as the Las Vegas Outlet center.  \n\nDefinitely your standard BWW.  The front part of the restaurant is a dinning room for families.  The back part is a huge bar, decorated with lots of big screen TVs for game watching.  Along side the bar are bar top tables, which we decided to sit at.  Our server was also the bartender and pleasant to work with.   I slipped him my card at the beginning so I could pay for the meal and he caught the hint, took the card from under the table and did a great job keeping it a secret from my bestie.  \n\nFor our meal, we started with the Mozzarella sticks for $6.49 and mini corn dogs for $5.79.  The mozzarella sticks crispy and perfectly breaded on the outside, and gooey mozzarella goodness on the inside.  The marinara dipping sauce made the stick taste like a good cheese pizza!  The corn dogs were literally bite sized hush puppy goodness.  The corn bread batter wasn't overpowering the dog.  There was a dipping sauce for this as well, mustard I think.  It made the corn dogs delicious!  I also decided to get the small boneless wings containing 10 boneless wings.  Parmesan Garlic was my flavor choice.  I liked the wing.  It was battered and super crunchy.  The Parmesan Garlic, on the other hand, was not as good as the actual wing.  It was too tangy and super salty.  It seemed like the wing was drenched in that sauce and very overpowering.  I was not a fan, to be honest.  \n\nFootball season is coming up, so you know I'll be at BWW at least couple more times during the season.  I love the service, I love the food, maybe just a different choice of sauce upon my return.  Love the central location and that means a bright future for me and BWW!"
"4","We love coming here to shop for groceries.  The parking is spacious and they keep the store clean and well organized.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kf3iHoF_pQ4TXRfNYpHTOQ?select=XBsrIfil9YRcS1DS8ufdmQ\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kf3iHoF_pQ4TXRfNYpHTOQ?select=TiCNHriXw3tgUQShZ7-KMA\n\nThey also have a good selection of Wine....yum!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kf3iHoF_pQ4TXRfNYpHTOQ?select=Kp4nvYrxcURzmeZiXBQUuA\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kf3iHoF_pQ4TXRfNYpHTOQ?select=9hDt7Xm8pyPFRMbpltngKw\n\nThe only thing I haven't been able to find here is the Pizza Crust from the Bakery that I used to get in the Albertson's in Vegas....apparently, they don't make them here.  Bummer!\n\nReturn Factor - 90%"
"2","My hubby and I LOVE Sushi. We have been all over the valley and we have our favorites. This place is definitely NOT our favorite. Wont be coming back. Prices are too high for quality. Came for Happy Hour and Their menu for it sucks. They have like 5 rolls no one wants on it. Too much rice on rolls. Rolls are loose and fall apart easy. And overall taste of the sushi was EH. Paid $44 for 2 people on HH. Tomo near by is much better!!"
"2","So normally I'm not that tough on places, but I think when you're serving Mexican food in Phoenix, there is a certain level of expectation.\n\nThey get one star for having decent service and another star for having quite good portions.  \n\nOn the other hand, the food was crap, especially for the price I was paying.  I had steak fajitas, not normally the cheapest thing, but for something between $12-$15 I expected something tastier.  If they had been the most delicious thing ever, I wouldn't have cared but I didn't even take the half of the food I had left home.  The steak had a funny after taste and a lot of my onions were burnt.  The beans were mediocre and tortillas were average.  \n\nOn the whole, it was a decent dining experience but not what I would have wanted for the price.  You can get a lot better Mexican food in Phoenix (and for a lot cheaper).  I'd recommend coming here only if it's the most convenient place."
"3","Came here not by choice but for a wedding reception and for the price u pay u would expect to have a great experience with excellent services and remarkable food. It was just mediocre and nothing more.\n\nThe hostess greets us nicely and confirm our reservations with 5 tables and made recommendations which I appreciate. We were all seated and our orders were all taken the same time. Altho the hostess were friendly, the waiters could have been more organize and communicate with each other and their tables. By the end of the night 4 out of 5 tables were served. Our friends at the 5th table did not get their dinner at all. The waiters did not want to take ownership at first. They blame the other waiters and the other blame the cooks and for a good 10min came with a conclusion that our friends at the 5th table should just pay for what they consume. One of our friend was so upset he put down his money for the dinner he did not receive and walked out while our couple friends did not agree and ask for a manger to make it right. After another 10min they finally made it right.\n\nAs for the food, I ordered the short ribs and it was above average but I enjoy the mushrooms and free complimentary bread more. My bf ordered the NY steak and did enjoy it but made a remark about for the price it was it should have came with sides. We both agree this would be a one time experience and would not come back again.\n\nI would have rated it a two star but I gaved it a three because of the friendly hostess and the manager finally making it right for our friends at table 5."
"4","Smashburger is good.  I prefer In 'n Out, but I can see why some people love this place.  The restaurant is typically clean, but some of the staff seem like they may use drugs."
"3","Came here at 5:30 on a Saturday night and we walked right in since it was pretty early. My family had the pepperoni flatbread pizza and they raved about it saying the bread is what made it special. Had the shrimp ravioli and it was good but nothing special, which is sort of the vibe going in the restaurant -- good but nothing special. Nice spices and and good bay shrimp garnished the ravioli, but the ravioli themselves were sort of rubbery and had an unpleasant texture. 5/5 for the service of Allegro, and 2/5 on the food, even the bread basket we got was cold, and if you're in the Wynn and want some good eatings consider Bartolotta but dress appropriately or one will be denied access."
"3","This is a review of their Happy Hour.\n\nThe Skinny: overall, the food's not bad - but could use some refinement (3.5) Service: pretty good but we also hit the Happy Hour as soon as they started (3.5) Value: not bad during Happy Hour but seems rather expensive during regular hours.\n\nWe walked into Herbs and Rye and immediately felt like we were in some sort of vampiric den. No windows, not much light, my hubby and I squinted as we tried to read the menus. Not to mention being blinded every time the door was opened.\n\nWe were seated promptly being the first ones there. We ordered an arugula salad, the gnocchi and the steak with a side of truffled mac 'n cheese.\n\nThe arugula salad was okay - but nothing special. The peppery flavour of the lettuce was rather unbalanced - requiring more acidity. It really needed something sweet to even those aggressive flavours out. Perhaps beets or fruit or something.\n\nThe gnocchi was delicious albeit it was slightly overcooked (I felt it was a little on the softer side). It was light and fluffy which is really hard to find. The ragu was also quite tasty and mellow. I didn't think that the gnocchi dish was improved with the addition of bacon and could do without it.\n\nThe steak was fine- cooked properly. The side of truffled mac 'n cheese was okay but not great. The sauce was a little too runny while the cheese overwhelmed the truffle flavour a bit.\n\nOverall, the dining experience would rate a 3. Just the gnocchi alone would get a 4. So we'll average it and call it a 3.5 star review."
"2","Food has good flavor, but I would have preferred a bigger portion of meat and hotter food. They really aren't out to impress, only to fill your belly."
"3","I'm truly 50/50 on my experience at the MGM so let me break it down for you.\n\nThings that I liked:\n\n- Super friendly staff. Every morning, there would be several people in the hallway and each would greet us with a \""Hello/Good morning/Have a nice day!\"" Love it!\n\n- Great location. I walked everywhere. Right across from New York, New York. A 10 minute walk to Planet Hollywood. Definitely manageable.\n\nThings I'm on the fence about:\n\n- The pool. It's a huge, sprawling complex but it gets crowded very early (like by 11 AM) and it's difficult to find a pool chair. Everyone seems to just lay their towel down and walk away. Very frustrating! The lazy river was nice and quite entertaining at 5 PM with all the drunk guys trying to hit on us while not being able to talk or walk. :)\n\n- The buffet. The food was good and there was a nice selection but the dinner buffet is severely overpriced at $36/person. You can see my buffet review for more info.\n\nThings I disliked:\n\n- The resort fee. It's very annoying to have to pay $25/day for things that I largely didn't use. Gym? Ha! Not in Vegas. Paper? Does anyone read the newspaper anymore? And this is coming from a journalism graduate. The only amenity included in the resort fee that I used was the internet and there's no way that should cost $25/day when I pay a total of $45/month at home. Ridiculous!\n\n- Drink prices at the pool. $22 for a pina colada!?! Eeks! No way!"
"1","Somehow we had this company come to our house even though we live in the Bay Area, California. The contractor called us from a 707 area code, so I know I have the right company. They've been out to our house TWICE and our refrigerator has not been fixed, even though we have paid them.\n\nHowever, today, we had a dumb *** contractor come to our house to look at our refrigerator. This contractor really should go back to school or something, cause he doesn't know what he is talking about. When my mother basically told him his idea of 'defrosting' a frost free refrigerator (keeping the door open and unplug it for 12 hours- uhhh plus, we'd lose a lot of food if we did that!), he lost his cool and starting being rude.\n\nI would really not deal with this company even if its the last applicance company on earth. The contractors are unprofessional and wasted our time, because my mom had to take a day off work for this."
"3","I travelled about 3000 miles to eat at Assagio's...oh wait, I'm eating at Lavo??? So the food was just ok.  I ordered the fettucini alfredo that could have come out of any Italian restaurant.  My sister's pasta was overly adante....or more like undercooked.  The service was slow and inattentive for a popular restaurant.  They brought out the appetizer before giving us any plates.  We even had to ask for plates haha maybe they wanted us to go at it savage style.  The best part of the meal was the complimentary garlic bread.\n\nThe decor and atmosphere was very nice.  Good for business meetings, dates and friends' outings.  \n\nThe reason for the extra star is because we came back for the nightclub and they put us in front of the line and gave us a complimentary table and drinks :)  Way to make a customer feel special!  The club area was small as well as the dance floor.  The music wasn't really my style as they were playing some random oldies.  The stairs on the way out were poorly lit, or rather not lit at all, causing my sis to fall.  But a second after, we were surrounded by flashlights and 8 gentlemen catering to our every need so plus to them for noticing!  I would come back again for the club, maybe not the restaurant."
"2","Hash House A Go Go was better last time.  I guess they gotten more popular that it's not the same. Super busy today... They even charge for extra sauce unlike before it was free. Food was okay. Some food was dry... Like the chicken and french toast. Doesn't have good flavor. Fruit was over ripe... Didn't get our water refill... Wouldn't recommend when there a lot of people waiting around..."
"4","The menu changed during 2013, and I preferred the previous menu to the new.  The new mock chicken is still the best around, but it's not as good as the previous. \n\nThe food here is awesome! Vegetarian or not, everyone loves this place. The food is creative, delicious and made from fresh ingredients.  The mock meats are so good and so well prepared that you will forget it's mock. I LOVE the wings, especially the new jalape\u00f1o flavor and the \""original g\"" or \""wendy's pickle\"" are great choices, but so is everything else on the menu. \nA tsoynami for dessert is a must, they have a long list of options, check them out, you will be in love. \n\nYou go up to the cashiers and grab a menu, take a seat and decide on your meal, then return the cashier to place your order. They will give you a number and bring out your meal, but there is no waiter service. \n\nThe ambiance is trendy, and laid back, very casual and welcoming."
"4","Who doesn't want to get a thrill BEFORE Halloween?! We did and it was well worth the money spent!\n\nAdmission line: None! We went right at 11:15PM on a weekday and it was quick and easy. We got the military discount price and was directed to be in line by 11:45 which was the last tour. Tour is open until midnight. \n\nEvent wait line: We had 3 groups in-front of us and we all stood there admiring the gory pictures on the wall as well as the life-sized creepy looking mannequins. Not crowded at all which is a huge plus!\n\nMain event: In my opinion, it was way too short. The actors were amazing and scary and so were the rooms. The actors would pop out of nowhere and give you a good scare! It was a bit too dark to see what's in front of you and because of this, I ran right into one of the guys hand in my group with my teeth when I was screaming/rapidly walking away from an actor with the chainsaw. I'm not going to give anything away but the highlight of the entire tour was probably the first two rooms. The rest will make you jump and scream a bit but the tour ended abruptly. =(\n\nStore/Photos: The store had nice shirts, tank tops, mugs, cups, and everything you would typically find after an attraction but with a touch of blood. Our photos that was taken right at the beginning was rushed. I didn't even get a chance to turn around to look at the camera before the air came blasting in my mouth; literarily. So our photos didn't capture my face/reaction, it did capture the props covering my head and torso. If the photo showed my face, it would have been an instant buy.\n\nOverall: Entertaining, scary, theatrical, gory, and dark. I wouldn't change anything except the way photos were taken only because I'm one of those people who love to buy those souvenirs pics. The rooms and actors are nothing that I've seen/experienced before and that is what makes this Goretorium awesome."
"2","Le Circus Circus est des plus vieux h\u00f4tels du Strip. Le check-in est tr\u00e8s impressionnant, on se croirait dans une gare ! Il faut dire que l'h\u00f4tel compte plus de 3 000 chambres. Notre chambre \u00e9tait dans la West Tower r\u00e9nov\u00e9e r\u00e9cemment : assez grande avec deux lits Queen size et une d\u00e9coration tr\u00e8s... am\u00e9ricaine. En revanche l'insonorisation est m\u00e9diocre.\n\n\n L'h\u00f4tel est situ\u00e9 au nord du strip, mais l'arr\u00eat du bus \""deuce\"" qui circule sur le boulevard est juste en face. Sachant que de toute fa\u00e7on vous marcherez beaucoup \u00e0 Las Vegas, la localisation n'est pas un souci.\n\n\n Le buffet \""All you can eat\"" co\u00fbte 15 $ mais il faut aimer manger gras.\n\n\n Le principal avantage de l'h\u00f4tel r\u00e9side dans son faible prix car sinon il est beaucoup moins confortable que les grands h\u00f4tels r\u00e9cents."
"5","Simply awesome food!"
"1","If you like watered down coffee, margarine, processed cheese product, and soggy toast, then this is the place for you. They know how to under cook and burn potatoes at the same time. Cheap, yes. And it shows."
"4","This was a great attraction for both a couple of native Pittsburghers and their out of town visitors. We learned a lot about our great city while on the tour. The tour guides were enthusiastic and entertaining and the ride was a lot of fun.  You even get the drive the boat in the water if you want!\n\nThe only minor issue we had was trying to book the tour. We called on Sunday night to make a reservation for Monday and the line was closed, so we left a message that was supposed to be returned. We didn't hear back so we just showed up at Station Square to buy our tickets for the 1:30pm trip. We were waiting for the bus to board when we received a phone call back...at shortly before 1:00pm. If we hadn't just come and took our chances we likely would have made other plans. So they need to clean up their reservation system (HELLO, online reservations?!)\n\nAlso be forewarned if you are taking more than one tour while you're visiting; apparently there is only one handbook for Pittsburgh tour guides, because a good number of the facts we heard were the same ones we heard on the Double Decker tour. It was still fun though!\n\nPS: Regarding the owner's comment below: We tried to make our reservations online but it was the day before the tour, and it said we could not do so. I think it would be better to be able to make your reservations any time; the day before shouldn't be too short of a notice."
"4","Some of LeSportsac's designs are a little too childish to be wearing on a daily basis but they started using more adult designs that aren't ridiculously cute.\n\nThey always seem to have sales so you can probably expect to pay about half off for a lot of bags."
"1","Horrible customer service and rude employees. I will never shop at this location again. I was just wanted to exchange sizes that I had purchased online and it was a nightmare. I ended up just returning and leaving with nothing."
"3","Good Burger, but over price."
"3","A group of us went to the Steel Cactus last Saturday for an early dinner.  While a few friends had already been to the restaurant, I was a newbie and was pleasantly surprised by the decor and atmosphere.  The restaurant patronage was somewhat sparse and they seemed really, really overstaffed (three hostesses??), but I suppose they were anticipating a later dinner rush.\n\nWhen we arrived, we asked for a table for five people and I'm not sure if the hostess has issues with judging sizes or what, but she put us in a booth that was clearly made for four people.  It was a little disappointing to look at the big, empty booth right next to us for our entire meal whilst one of our party was forced to sit in a chair on the end of a rounded table...\n\nAnyway, the waitress was nice and we placed orders for our food.  I personally was not disappointed in the nachos I orded (HUGE!), but some of us whom ordered meals were a bit disappointed by their portions.  I tasted everybody's food and while it was good, I can't say that there was anything spectacular about any of the food.  The fish tacos were extremely bland.\n\nOf course, I would go back to the Steel Cactus and try some of their other options, but overall for their pricing and what I've already tried, I can't say I'm going to go into with the highest of expectations."
"2","I ordered a Subway Club with lettuce tomatoes and mayonnaise and I had to explain to the guy making the sandwich 3 times what I wanted on it. Then my sons ordered a meatball sub and the guy kept insisting on it being toasted even after we humbly declined. Finally they got the order right after after 10 minutes of explanation.  The manager did however give us a free upgrade to a combo meal because of the incompetence of his sandwich maker."
"1","First time here and the waitress was rude, plus she came up to our table within 5 minutes of being seated and wanted us to order, I didn't even get to look at the menu. It wasnt even busy restaurant was basically empty"
"5","The day after a long drive to Vegas and a night of too much drinking, which ended with a slumber on an armchair, I needed a retinkering of my neck/back/body/soul.   While I'm used to $15-20/hr foot massages in the San Gabriel Valley, I knew that a good deal could be found in Chinatown-LV simply because I see tens of slightly shady-looking places all throughout Spring Mountain Road.   However, very few of them have the smarts to post a \""yelp deal\"" to attract out-of-towners looking for a cheap fix.   The Foot Spa is a clean, quiet, and serene place that is staffed with adept masseuses that provide a relaxing massage at a very affordable/acceptable price.  \n\nBefore going with 4 of my friends, I made a quick phone call to book a \""reservation\"" which would give them some time to rally up their masseuses (they aren't on site at all times, and are actually shuttled around I believe).   My group did the 25 min foot soak to \""detox\"" our body of alcohol and um other stuff, which really was just a chance to get sleepy before the real massage lol  My water turned \""orange/brown\"" which meant my joints had issues (I was more expecting black water which was liver issues from booze lol).  My joints have been pretty good lately....so I guess the detox was detoxing unnecessary ailments :P  But who cares, the couches are really comfortable and it gives you a chance to just relax in a pool of water.\n\nSo my masseuse was a bit late compared to the other 4 that were working on my friends, so the \""receptionist/manager\"" said she would give me a massage while I waited.  OMG she was probably the most skilled and strong masseuse I've had ever had and I was so happy my guy/girl was late.  Sadly, this came to an end about 10 minutes later when another guy came whose hands felt like limp noodles compared to this Superwoman Massage-trained-receptionist-manager.  But my guy was still pretty good because I still passed out and started to snore (according to my friends).  Once it was all said and done, I felt super refreshed and ready to dance the night away and re-distort my body!  \n\nI ended up having the best drunken night of my life with seemingly unlimited pain-free dancing.  When I awoke the next morning with my head in the toilet, my neck still felt limber and loose.  I attribute all of this to my great massage @ The Foot Spa\n\n**I recommend paying the extra $10 for a full back massage at the end, it was icing on the cake and REALLY gets all the knots out of your vertebrae and spinal area**\n\nI am going to return to find the superwoman receptionist to give me my next massage in 2013 lol\n\n\nTotal cost $29 + 10 + $11 for tip: $50 spend that could have been blown in 5 minutes at a Vegas Table"
"2","40mins later and still waiting for my order! My first time here and I'm never coming back.."
"3","#Vakseen4taste this Vegas trip we decided to stay a few miles away from the strip so when we woke up super hungover Sunday morning, Embers' menu was calling me. I was eyeing the fried chicken and biscuits or the blueberry ricotta pancakes. Only a mile away, we hopped in a cab and were seated immediately. \n\nBest cure for a hangover? MORE DRINKS!!!  While the unlimited mimosas, bellinis and bloody Mary's definitely sounded appealing, they have a great beer selection so I went that route. FYI the wait or said those unlimited are interchangeable so you can bounce from a mimosa to a bloody, etc. I'm a Belgian drinker and they had a few of my favs so I drank bottles of Trappistes Rochefort 10, followed by Westmalle Tripel after the food came out. What hangover?!  \n\nWe both ordered the blueberry ricotta pancakes and I'll actually have to say I was pretty disappointed. On one hand, they served their purpose and soaked up last nights intoxication, on the other hand, the pancakes looked much more amazing than they truly were. Perfect in appearance, they were a little doughy and truly lacked flavor. I felt like I was eating bland white bread. They were so doughy that I had to look and make sure they were actually cooked. Neither the blueberries not the sauce were sweet and we actually ended up putting syrup on them. A lightly flavored lemon ricotta ball was placed on top of the pancakes just like butter normally is and that wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. Sadly the food was nothing to write home about. I will say their chicken sausage was very good though. The highlight of brunch lol.  Welp at least the service was on point lol. Food 6.5/10. Service 8.5/10. Atmosphere 8/10"
"1","My sister & I were approached by a promoter on the sidewalk who offered us free passes to get in, but since we already booked one of the party-bus club-hops we did not need them.\nArrived at The Bank and got in line with the rest of our party.  Did not wait long to be told that most of the WOMEN in our group would not be getting in because they were not wearing high enough heels.  Bouncers were horribly mean- most of our group ended up in tears.  \n\nI know most people reading this will think that the problem was with our party bus group and not with the bouncers, but I assure you that all of the ladies were wearing club style dresses with nice shoes (no flip flops or anything like that) JUST NOT HOOKER HEELS.  \nFunny ending- walked out past the same promoter who gave me his card on the street, showed it to him and asked if there was anything he could do to which he replied, \""HUhhhhhhhh? Ummmmmmmm?\"""
"2","While Nikolas was an excellent server, rating the overall experience as average... The bread used to be so wonderful - now it is  like the bread is delivered frozen and then microwaved - at least it tasted that way... \n\nThe salad was very \""vinegary\"" and the filet was ... \""eh\"". Even the Lobster was less than desirable...\n\nNot the keg we remember :-( Carrabba's Italian Grill is ALWAYS reliable and delicious... we may never be back!"
"2","I was a bit disappointed with this place. I came here last year loving it and I decided to try this place again. Did anyone notice that the sushi roll rice was premade? They had stacks of these made.....granted there are only 2 sushi chefs, but still how long does it take to put some rice on seaweed? The fish was dry, the rolls all tasted the same and there was just TOO much sauce. The only saving grace was the sakitini. The mango flavored sakitini was too strong for me, but the rasberry one was good. I wanted to like it, but I just wasn't all that in to it."
"3","*****Spring Restaurant Week 2013****\n\nThis is only my second time dining at a Lagasse place, first time doesn't really count, went to Lagasse's Stadium at Palazzo. So I can't really compare. \n\nMade a reservation thru Open Table for 5pm on a Saturday, we were seated right away, as they had just opened. The ambiance is nice, loved the wine bottles displayed in the middle of the restaurant. Our server immediately came over and introduced himself and took our drink orders. \n\nMy eyes lit up when I saw the bread basket had pretzel bread in it, Joe's Stone Crab is my other spot that I usually fill up on their pretzel bread. Who knew this would be the highlight of my meal, actually my glass Sauvignon Blanc was a highlight. Anywho, this is what I ordered:\n\nCold Salmon Tartare-this was good, served with flat bread. Good flavor.\n\nHorseradish blue shrimp with cous cous-this was a huge let down. The dish had no hint of horseradish at all, it was more of a BBQ taste than anything else. I believe it was Isreali cous cous, so they are a bit larger and have a slightly different texture than regular cous cous. \n\nBanana Cream Pie-I can't really judge this as I guess I'm not a fan of banana cream pie, my guess is if this is your thing, it was probably delicious. I was trying to be different and order something I wouldn't normally order.\n\nI don't see myself ever coming back here or recommending to anyone to try, even if it's RW."
"4","Always a good pizza!  We frequent Grimaldi's and everytime we go, there are no surprises - we consistently get friendly service and great tasting pizza not to mention a fresh garden salad - fresh veggies and tasty dressing!"
"1","First let me start by saying that I rarely complain or request money back, however this is a time that I felt it was appropriate and needed.  Lesson learned is that Strut and staff will say anything to sell a dress! \n\nI got engaged February of 2013 and we set a wedding date for late June 2013.  \n\nI am 6'0 and about a size 16 (I can flux depending on the style between a 14 and an 18).  I have previously been married and my first wedding dress needed NO ALTERATIONS.  As a high school student, I wore a 14 and modeled in bridal shows for local shops because they didn't have to alter their dresses to fit me.  I am tall but extremely proportionate, so I rarely need more than a hem dropped in pants, skirts or dresses. \n\nI made an appointment and brought seven friends with me. I met with Jill; not the owner Ann.  I found a dress that I liked but it was HUGE!  It stayed on with four clamps.  It was big and over my budget (about $1250.00) but it was available for purchase that day.  Allure Bridal 8809.  I later found the dress online for a fourth of my purchase price!  \n\nJill repeatedly advised me that a seamstress could take in any dress that was four sizes too big.  I should have thought it out, this dress was way more than four sizes too big.  I asked several times, are you sure this dress can be taken in?  I was repeatedly told that it would not be a problem.  I was actually given two recommendations for tailors.  \n\nI believed her; though I had a weird feeling about it (you know the weird feeling Oprah tells you to pay attention to) but I knew I did not have time to order a dress.  I then went to pay for the dress and my debit card declined.  I thought this was weird and asked her to run it again.  It declined again.   My friend then charged it to her Am Ex no problem.  \n\nI checked my bank account the next day, the dress had actually been charged to my checking account twice putting a hold on my account.  GREAT all that money locked up!  But that was just the start of the problem.\n\nAbout two weeks after my purchase, I called and made an appointment with tailor Jenny Barnes (a Strut recommendation).  \n\nMid-May I went to Jenny.  I put the dress on or at least held it to my body.  Jenny looked at me and said, \""Who sold you this dress?\""  I said I went to Strut, she said was it Ann?  I said no.  She said the dress was entirely too big and it never should have been sold to me.  Jenny said this to me on my first visit, to my mother on our second alterations appointment , again to me on the third alterations appointment and again to my friend who attended, YES, the fourth alteration appointment. \n\nIt took Jenny four appointments and cost me $530.00 in alterations and I didn't even have a bustle put in.  Jenny did everything she could, but ultimately she couldn't size it completely because the dress would have lost its shape. \n\nI called Strut because I felt they should pay for the alterations.  I spoke with Ann who was initially gracious about the issue.  She told me she would contact Jenny, discuss the matter and call me back.\n\nI then talked to Jenny who told me that Ann had threatened her and refused to send her any more business.   Jenny has been in busy for 20 plus years, she formally worked for Neiman Marcus.  She has a phenomenal reputation on Yelp.  \n\nMy wedding came and went... Jenny did what she could but the cup size was so big in the dress that I had to put four, yes four, athletics socks in the bust area.   \nI gave Ann some additional time to call me back.   NO PHONE CALL.\n\nI called today and Ann put the blame on Jenny and myself.  She said I had lost weight and that's why the dress was so big (I lost maybe 5 lbs and that doesn't show on my 6'0 frame).   She told me that if I was unhappy with Jenny, I should have gone to another tailor.  That Jenny told her that I wanted the dress to be tighter than Jenny could make it (are you kidding me, I had my friend pulling up the neckline before I walked down the aisle so the dress wouldn't slip down).   In other words she took absolutely no responsibility.  STRUT WILL DO ANYTHING TO SELL A DRESS! \n\nI am a proud supporter of local businesses - BUT NOT THIS ONE.  I expect professional, courtesy from a local business (I mean this isn't trashy David's Bridal).  If Ann had followed up with me and explained the situation or offered to contribute to the cost of the alterations, or offered a veil or other service I would not be writing this complaint.  DO NOT TRUST THEM, THEY WILL TELL YOU ANYTHING TO SELL A DRESS!"
"2","It was time for our comforter (Queen 1200 thread count Egyptian Cotton) to be cleaned, we've had it done once before at Owen's which is no longer in business.\n\nCC is close and convenient so I decided to try there. I walked in and the clerk just looked at me until I said \""Hello, I'm here to drop off my comforter\"" as I plopped the bag onto the counter. Again, I was met with a stare and awkward silence until he informed me I had to take it out of the bag, so I did and he inspected it then held up the corner were the tag used to be and shot me a look of annoyance. I told him what it was then another person came out of the back and asked me what the filling was I said I wasn't exactly sure. The woman asked if it was down, I told her no it was not, that much I did know. She also inspected it and told me it could not be dry cleaned, to take it home and wash it. I informed her it had been done before and after I said it won't fit in my washer, she told me take it to a commercial cleaner. She explained all the stuffing would go to the corners and there would be nothing in the middle so I had to get a ball to put in the dryer then sent me on my way.\n\nI took my business elsewhere and they did a wonderful job. So yes, it could be done."
"4","When I first went to Gates and Brovi a few months ago, I was an almost instant fan. The restaurant is a a good place to go with a family or group of friends, especially with the two large picnic-style tables that are fun for groups of friends or a party.\n\nThe food is American, with a menu that sways towards being seafood-centered. Indeed, the seafood is reasonably good for a land-locked area.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor is an interesting and fresh take on a north woods supper club combined with what seems to be a New England clam shack or seafood place. The owners took these two modest but character-filled venues and spiffed it up a ton, with high ceilings and large windows that fill the room with natural light at lunchtime. Hardwood floors and vintage north woodsy shiny beer signs give the place a nostalgic but also cool and fresh look. Most design elements are tasteful and a good bit kitschy. The seating is mostly wooden, so it takes a little bit of a hit on comfort. However, there is a table and seating that can please everybody. There are traditional tables and chairs, bar stools at the bar, booths, high padded seats around a table,  and even two wood picnic tables that I mentioned earlier.\n\nRecently, Gates and Brovi expanded their menu to a double-sided page, which added lots of items that can appeal to many tastes. The crowd favorite, and one that I would highly recommend for any newcomer to this restaurant, is the G & B burger. It is divine, with a delicious sauce and a goey, drippy, richness. As with a good amount of their other menu items, the burger requires more than a few of the flimsy paper napkins. Also good to try is the beer steamed shrimp. Soaking in a delicious -broth? -brine? each shrimp absorbs loads of rich flavor, and compensates for the average seafood that is served. Appetizers are delicious and there is a good amount to choose from. The fries are a good thing to automatically get if you are with other people, because the large size comes with a lot and is the cheapest of the appetizers.   The fries are perfectly hot and crispy and have just the right amount of oiliness. My brother had the cheese curds one time and said they were very awesome. One downside is that the brown sugar roasted pork sandwich is so choked with greens and a soggy slop that it was hard to pick out the pork flavor, which didn't have that much flavor anyway (Where was the brown sugar part of it? I couldn't taste it). Many things are very messy and soggy and require lots of napkins. There is one mediocre paper napkin that comes with your silverware but that runs out pretty quickly. There are dispensers on each table, but each napkin that comes out of those is so flimsy and thin that you end up having a huge pile of wadded-up paper at the end of your meal.\n\nService is a strong point, with wait staff that are friendly and courteous. When my mother got the wine she ordered, it came not quite as chilled as some might like it. The waitress was very helpful and offered to refrigerate it for longer, which worked. When the wine came back, it was a good deal colder but still in a non-stemmed beer-like glass. Apparently they do not have stemmed glasses for wine, so you have to have it in a regular beer sampler glass.\n\nOther users have mentioned parking being a problem, although I live close and usually walk there. It is true that there is no parking lot in the daytime, and you have to resort to side streets. After 7:00 you can park in the Mallatt's parking lot, which is right next to the restaurant. Along with their expanded menu, they also added a parking diagram which handily points out which streets are good to park on.\n\nAll in all, this is a great place to take the family, or the relatives in town, or anybody for that matter. The food is amazing, especially for the price you pay and the portion size you get. If you are looking for your next place to eat"
"3","Just your typical, untrained, understaffed, Walgreen. Just went there to pickup a couple of things. Had to asked three employees if they had it. then it took almost twenty minutes to check out. At least they had what I was looking for!"
"1","My Letter to Fat Tuesday's Corporate Office:\n\nGood Afternoon,\n\nI am writing in regards to the horrible customer service that was given to us at your Las Vegas, MGM location this past Sunday-9/8/13.\n\nWe were treated horribly by one of your servers; I believe her name was Jennifer.\nThis was the first time we visited your location and we were very excited to try one of your infamous drinks on our vacation.\n\nJennifer was the server that day and it was pretty slow when we came by. Jennifer was the only server and there was another group of people there before us-4 young men. Jennifer was very hospitable to them, she had even been chatting with the gentleman when we arrived. My group and I waited patiently, chatting amongst ourselves while she assisted them. After about 5-7 minutes, she still had not acknowledged us and was still having conversation with the young men while she made their drinks.\n\nMy friends stayed waiting for her on one end of the bar, while I got up and walked over to her. I stood there waiting for a few minutes, and finally sat down right in front of Jennifer to get her attention-after all we just wanted to quickly grab our drinks and head on our way for our plans that day. Jennifer never looked up at me, or even said a word. The whole time I was sitting there, I started to grow very angry-I couldn't believe she was not even acknowledging that I was there. I even observed her get on her cell phone while making more drinks for the same 4 gentlemen and she just kept chatting away.\n\nAt this point my friends said forget it; they didn't want a drink from Fat Tuesday's anymore. Unfortunately, one gal we were with still wanted to try one of the Fat Tuesday specials...so I stayed waiting in front of Jennifer. After about 10-12 minutes of sitting in front of her, she finally came to me and asked what I wanted. I told her and she asked what flavor I would like, so I told her \""actually it is for the girl down there (I gestured to the other end of the bar), so I am not sure. I was just sitting here to get your help, but you can ask her.\"" Jennifer still not moving from where the young men were, proceeded to tell me that she needs to see everyone's ID's and I said, \""sure, they (gestured again to where my friend's were-a few steps away at the other end of the bar) will show you their ID's\"". I then walked to the other end of the bar where my friends were and thought Jennifer was following me. I was shocked when I looked up and saw she was still sitting there talking to the young men.\n\nFinally one of my friends yelled to her, \""hello, can we please get some help here?\"", that is when Jennifer-your staff, shouted back to where we were sitting and said \""I NEED TO SEE YOUR ID's!\""\nThis made all of us so upset. \n\nWe all had no problem presenting our ID's, but Jennifer never even made the attempt to walk over to us to see our ID's or ask us what we would like.\n\nIs this the way you train your staff? \nThis was our first time there, and this is how we were treated...we felt awful. Not a great way to start our vacation.\n\nMy apologies if we were interrupting Jennifer's conversation with these gentlemen, but it is my experience that if you are working in the establishment-ALL of your customers should be assisted in a timely manner, not to mention with excellent customer service so they would be left with the great feeling of wanting to come back again.\nThis was not the case here and I am hoping that with my message, management would address this situation in a fair and reasonable manner.\n\nThank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon."
"2","I am going to get right to the point...they have some cool stuff for sale at good prices...hence 2 stars. Otherwise, their customer service is ghetto and sucks!!! What a shame!!!!!! End of story!!!!!!!!!"
"1","WOW! I should have read these reviews before walking in to this Little Caesars. Appearantly the people running this store don't give a crap about the nasty customer service at this location.  They lost a customer for sure. Never again"
"2","Have been here a few times. The food is not bad but not really great either when you are paying $30+ per entree. The service always seems sketchy. and a bit uppity a la Summerlin location . Last night, with just a few people in the place, we got seated right next to a couple chatting away. I felt like I was at the same table with them. Couldn't figure out why the hostess did this. We got up and went to PF Changs. Not a good experience."
"5","First time here, service was great as soon as we walked in the door. I had the Shrimp and Grits, very very good! Our server Rikki was very nice and attentive. I look forward to coming back."
"1","Beer still warm and service slow. Food was not hot. You would think they would want to have the coldest beer but as usual, they don't seem to care. Place is always empty and the reputation is going down"
"4","Having a bit of a wander around Edinburgh and looking for something just a little lighter than standard fare for this city.  We tried this funky little place and really enjoyed our lunch.  Great service and a nice decor.  Try the spinach, goat cheese, and sweet potato pie."
"4","daughter and i were in vegas in april this year,. we had a coupon for  buy one get one free  entree she had mushroom chicken and i had   shrimp and chicken with pineapple.. the   entree  on both was  fresh and  good.. the  plate  was huge i am  headed back to vegas  june  4th.. and  wil  go back here..  yummmmmmmm"
"1","Thursday, March 21, 2013 - Approx. 6:00 PM\n\nMy wife and I had just arrived in town from Utah. We were staying at the Silverton Resort (right around the corner from the Global Truck Wash on Valley View Blvd.\nWe had come to Vegas to spend a few days attending a large gathering of motorcycle riders.\n\nWhen we left Utah, it had been snowing and our Yukon along with our open-trailer had become pretty dirty with a few hundred miles of wet road grime. As soon as we were all checked-in to the hotel, the first thing I wanted to do was give our vehicle and the motorcycle a good a wash. So, I searched Yelp, and found that the Global Wash was right around the corner. And, it had good reviews. Just what I needed, I thought.\n\nWhen we arrived to the entrance of the Global Wash (pulling the trailer with the motorcycle on it), we saw two guys who appeared to be employees standing next to the area where the vehicles drive in to be washed. The business gave every impression of it being open (meaning that there were no cones or any sort of barricade at the entrance), and since it didn't appear busy, we proceeded to drive in. When I reached the halfway point between the driveway entrance and the actual wash area, one of the guys (a young Hispanic man dressed in a white t-shirt, perhaps about twenty-something years old), began walking towards my vehicle and while waving his arms, he repeatedly \""shouts back-up, get outta here\"". When I asked, why? He responds that \""I'm trespassing\"". I then said that \""I was just looking to get a wash\"", to which he demands that \""I back-up and leave\"". I then explained that I was not very experienced in backing-up trailers, and asked him politely if it would be possible for me to just pull through instead of attempting to back up.\n\nI understand if a business is closed, and its employees just want to go home at the end of the day. And, if I had just been told that the wash was closed, I would have understood and left. But, what happened next was completely unexpected. The employee who had approached me, he began yelling swearing at me and telling me how \""all of you Mormons from Utah are all cheap, etc., etc.\"" Mormons? Why would he think I'm Mormon? Anyway, he appeared so antagonistic I wondered if he was looking for a physical fight. At that point, I was more than willing to leave as quickly and quietly as possible. What outright and undeserved bigotry. This guy seemed crazy!\n\nSo, I did my best to do a U-Turn in the driveway, and I did knock down a few of those little orange cones on the way out, but fortunately, no damage done to anyone or anything.\n\nI would be surprised if this information even gets any attention. For all I know, maybe that guy was the owner, or a friend of the employer? Maybe this incident will be completely ignored. I will certainly never set foot there again. \nWhy would employers ever hire someone like that? Whatever the case, this kind of inexcusable behavior should never be tolerated by an employer. Its poor customer service, at its best, and that guy should go work somewhere where he doesn't have to work with people - especially Mormons I guess?\n\nSo, no stars for this experience unfortunately. But, I would suggest that people stay away from Global Truck Wash as long as that guys works there. He seems dangerous!"
"4","I pass by this place all the time between work and just in general. So looking forward too checking it out plus always good thing try new restaurant yelp about. Lol! My first impression is not feel like normal taco or mexican restaurant. No over the top decor granted still some things keeps it real. The menu is decent size but I was in the mood for some tacos, rice, and beans. I got two lingua and two carne asada. Side each of rice and beans. Not use too because fan of Pepe Tacos or Roberto so rice and beans comes automatic. I wanted too try as much things on the menu as one person can. Fan of that the others not offer is got chips and salsa (in cool pepper bowl) comes with order. Chips really enjoy the salsa was ok. I felt salsa could have been more hearty and little more kick too it. Just my personnel taste buds talking. The tacos was awesome! They gave nice size portion of meat in both! The rice and beans both ok nothing special pass on next time just stick with the tacos."
"1","The service was below average. I received a glass of water that clearly had a large black item floating on top. The waitress never apologized and claimed it was simply parsley. \n\nThe food was not that great either. The calamari was over cooked and rubbery. The pizza was under cooked, and me and my date both became ill from the food. It is unlikely that we will return."
"5","When your looking for speed, quality, and price, this place hits on all marks. Some of the best tacos i've ever had in my life. I like that you can try all sorts of different meats from head, tongue, leg, and even cheek meat. On my last visit I think that I ordered almost one of every style of taco. What was really outstanding was the grilled green onions and peppers you can get as a side, probably the best version out of any taqueria in Vegas. The corn tortillas are very good as well. Everything is very clean and the prices are right on point. Everything tasted fresh and well made, I liked it. This place also seems to be packed, and there is a good reason."
"1","Horribly inattentive service. Our waiter saw we had a toddler and basically treated us like we were second class citizens! Our son is actually well behaved in restaurants too - so it was unjustified! We ordered food for him, a couple of appetizers and some sushi rolls....  We wanted more sushi but he never came back to check on us. Our waters were empty and ice melted, sons plate was clean and we were twiddling our thumbs when the busser realized we were finished and sent waiter over - no questions asked, dropped check and ran off again. Busser took credit card and gave to waiter and we never saw that guy again.... Weird. No thanks - I will stick with sushi 101, they're attentive and much cheaper. Not to mention, parking is no where near as difficult - hope Jade gets it together."
"4","I have always been a fan of the original brass money, so have been looking for an excuse to check out the new one and finally got around to it.  While the original had a fair few flaws, it had a great character and feel about it.  The new one manages to keep the character and charm, but irons out many, if not all of the niggles.\n\nThis new one in Leith is much, much bigger than the original, with plenty of space for  people to sit, plenty of space for people to move and plenty of space for people to get served at the bar.  It would cater just as well for a couple having a quiet drink to a large crowd looking to have a catch up.  I went around lunchtime and while it was quiet, it didn't feel empty.  The range of comfy furniture (mainly old style chairs and sofas with big and small tables) which gave it a very homely feel.\n\nThey have a great selection of drinks, a good menu, good tunes and friendly staff.\n\nThis is definitely the kind of place that you could find yourself \""stopping\"" in for one and then spending the day there, as they have designed it so you feel at home from the second you walk in and I will be looking forward to returning very soon."
"3","We went from University City to Fort Mill on St. Patrick's day, to pick up a license plate for a car my wife bought in February. The kids were hungry, and we weren't into the whole St. Patrick's Day mood. \n\nWe hadn't had Italian food in a while, so I navigated to this place via Yelp on the iPhone. It's in a professional building, underneath a dentist's office, adjacent to a bunch of strip malls on Gold Hill Road. \n\nWe found it odd that it was cold in the restaurant, on what was otherwise a very warm March 17.  The waitress offered to let us sit outside, and so we did. Never mind the bird poop on the wrought iron table... Or the fact that the patio hadn't been swept in a while. \n\nWe were promptly served the highlight of the meal, a basket of probably the best garlic knots I've ever tasted, complete with herbed butter. My boys demanded we get a second basket with our meal. \n\nI'm always suspicious of Italian restaurants that don't have some decent coffee available. When asked, the waitress didn't even know if they did. \""That's okay, I'll drink water...\"" \n\nOddly, some folks behind us were served great-smelling coffee about 20 minutes later. I wasn't offered, so I resisted ordering it.\n\nMy universal complaint about most mom and pop Italian restaurants from NY to FLA to CA  is that they don't seem to do salads much justice, and they charge too much for them when they're ordered a' la carte. This place was no exception. \n\nWe found it interesting that the salad Twin B received as an accompaniment to his meal had a nice array of romaine and other lettuces on it, along with croutons, while my wife and I had to endure the non-nutritional value of iceberg and a sparse sampling of veggies. Twin A had ordered a special salad to go with his pizza. It came with great olives and just a few more veggies. \n\nI ordered a crab-stuffed sole, which came with broccoli and mashed potatoes. Twin A ordered a pizza. Twin B ordered a pasta dish with a heavy, herbed cream sauce and some tomatoes. My wife had grilled salmon and broccoli. \n\nThe first thing I noticed about my plate was that the fish and broccoli seemed to be drenched in butter. Now, I like a little butter now and then, but dammit, it's 2012, and most people now know that it's not a a healthy fat to coat a whole meal in. A big draw of Mediterranean food is its heart-healthy reliance on lean meats, fresh veggies, whole grains, and olive oil. So where did all that butter come from? I'm not used to Italian fish dishes or veggies being drenched in butter.\n\nAnyway, the sole was okay. The crab stuffing was greasy and bland, The broccoli had no flavor beyond the butter, and the mashed, skin-on red potatoes were very, very good. Oddly, they were served with little or no added butter! I just dipped them in the ooze from the rest of the food.\n\nTwin A loved his pizza, saying the cheese and olives were awesome, despite a limp, wet crust.\n\nTwin B did not like the heavy, herbed cream sauce that came on his penne. I tried it and found it to have an odd, chemical taste, and to be so heavily laden with fat that I could see why he was disappointed He could probably feel his arteries seizing up after just a few bites.\n\nMy wife said the Salmon was just okay. There was nothing special about it. Her broccoli did look like it had less butter on it than mine.\n\nThe damage was $69 and change with tip, no alcohol. Entrees are generally in the $13 to $18 range, with pastas not far behind. Pizzas are a little less.\n\nOverall, the experience was \""Meh\"" for the salads and entrees, \""Yay!\"" for the garlic knots, pizza, and mashed potatoes. We have definitely had better Italian food for less money in many other places. I'd probably take my son's advice and order the pizza if I were you."
"2","If you don't want to drop a lot of money on Asian cuisine in a luxury hotel, Rice and Company is a good choice.\n\nIf you want to drop some money on Asian cuisine in a luxury hotel and be ignored by a staff of three while sitting at the bar by yourself to the point where you wonder if there's a shortage of drinking water and bills for your food in Las Vegas, Rice and Company is also a good choice. \n\nThe funniest part? After pushing my empty dishes away and sitting in my seat with a card in an outstretched hand for nearly 10 minutes, I couldn't wait and had to use the bathroom. So I tried an experiment. I left my phone and the card barely peeking out from my book, which I draped over both items. After I returned from the bathroom, a server took it upon himself to lecture me on the dangers of leaving phones and cards unattended. And then I waited for my tab for another 10 minutes. \n\nClearly, nobody at Rice and Company is planning to steal your belongings, or even handle them with your consent. But they will rip you off as far as your time. It's a pity, because the fried rice I brought back to my room as leftovers was mighty tasty in the morning. I probably should have saved myself nearly half an hour and done the dine and dash."
"4","Checking in was easy only a 10 minute wait. We stayed on the 4th fl in a Park Avenue room with a view of Excalibur and MGM, the rollercoaster did not bother us. The room is of decent size, the bed was comfortable and the was room clean. The t.v. is old, but who wants to watch t.v. in Vegas, I'll do that at home. I like taking hot showers, the bathrooms could use a fan. Got too steamy. It was a long walk from the elevator to our room, almost too long. Didn't go to the pool but walked by, looked small. Didn't try out the gym or spa either. The line was slow for a players card and getting comped. The sportsbook is weak. Probably 9 seats and you strain your neck trying to watch the t.v.'s. \n\nI think it's overrated as a 4 star property. Given the level of service and room I think it's more of a 3-3.5 star property. I only paid $55 a night so can't complain. \n\nNot a fan of the $12.95 resort fee. Why don't they just build that into the room rate. \n\nIt's at the other end of the strip so it's a long walk to the hotels by Bellagio.\n\nI didn't lose all of my money and they comped 4 nights of our stay. All in all I would stay here again if I got a good rate.\n\nI gave 4 stars based on what I paid. If I paid more, I would have given 3 stars."
"5","I went to a lunch here with my sister and her family. It was pretty busy, but luckily they got there first to wait for the table. The waitress was super nice. I ordered some sort of pesto pasta that had chicken and prosciutto in it. Everything was delicious. I would've normally given this place 4 stars because I have to be really impressed to get a 5, but when that cheesecake hit my tongue that bumped it up the extra star. Glad that they live up to the hype of their cheesecake."
"3","I have to agree with others and say that this Panera is slow. I have waited over 30 minutes at lunch. \n\nAt breakfast (typically a slower time) I have happened to seat myself near the kitchen. I'm surprised anything comes out of that place correctly!\n\nNevertheless, the food has always been properly prepared on my orders so I'll give them three stars."
"2","My review is strictly based on the restaurant and food as I never actually made it in the the saloon dance hall area. Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of BBQ and was very excited to try Gilley's for the first time. I was disappointed from the minute I opened the menu. I must have flipped through it front to back and back to front three or four times because I felt like I was just overlooking a section that listed brisket. Sadly I wasn't overlooking anything. Gilley's does not have any type of brisket whatsoever; not even so much as a chopped brisket sandwich. How can a place with a huge neon outline of Texas on the wall with it's original roots in Houston, TX serve not serve brisket? I know there are a lot of other types of BBQ out there and I am sure I am biased because of the fact the I was born and raised in the Lone Star state, but I have a hard time accepting a BBQ place that doesn't have brisket as at least one of it's offerings. Aside from the disappointment of not having brisket, the food I did have was definitely not anything special. We started off with the \""Texas\"" nachos, they must have felt the need to get the word TX in there, but they were just nachos and we're a sad version of them at that. I can't take your nachos seriously when the melted cheese is a liquid you poured out of a can. The BBQ ribs, side of mashed potatoes and corn bread we're decent at the very best. I may visit the bar again at some point, but will definitely be eating elsewhere."
"3","Mickey's Tavern is a \""nice\"" place. They have nice bartenders and really cozy atmosphere, so if you are in the casual mood, this is a good place to come with friends and talk. I'm not sure if this would be a party scene. Summer months seem to have more fun as the outside seating area open up.\n\n*Updates*\nI had the chance to sit outside and enjoy a very fine evening with friends. We ordered \""Sexy fry\"", which supposedly is a french fry with truffle oil. It was SO good especially on a empty stomach after a softball game. It was a perfect accompaniment to beer and good time."
"2","I've been here maybe 5x over the year I've been in Vegas.  Love the atmosphere and outside tables but after living in Portland, OR - the coffee really is overpriced and nothing special. Takes awhile to get coffee. Place is more about atmosphere than coffee that just amazes."
"4","I could not belive my eyes when I walk into this store,this store has a huge selection of every and any kind of  jerky you can think of,also dried fruit & nuts candies,Japanese & Chinese seeds.They sell Dasani water 16oz. for .95 WOW when every I am in that area and need to quench my thirst you know where I will be heading staff was very helpful too."
"1","I made the mistake of going here on a whim. Awful, shitty bland Mexican food. A waste of money and my butthole was angry with me."
"2","Went for lunch and really was not impressed. I had their lunch special which was salad and a small 8\"" pizza for 9 bucks. Not really a deal in my book. I had the Buffalo Chicken pizza (their special for the day) and the pizza crust tasted like cardboard. Their house salad was drowning in balsamic and oil. I could barely taste any of the great toppings on the salad. \n\nThe only reason I gave this place two stars was because the staff was friendly and prompt."
"4","We had dinner three weeks ago, food was good and good portions.  We were able to plat gages and kept our self entertained"
"2","i have mixed reviews of this bar & grill. WARNING: THIS PLACE IS ONLY OPEN ON GAME DAYS. THEIR ANSWERING MACHINE DOESN'T TELL YOU THAT!! first, it's a cool place. i went here before the diamondbacks game. it's cold inside, the 5 or so tvs are nice, nice low tables & hi-tops. not over the top crowded. THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO DRINK BEFORE OR AFTER THE GAME.  the bottled beer was $2.50. this is definitely priced below other places around the ballpark. other places, on average, are about $4.00 a bottle. HOWEVER, we weren't impressed with the food. there were no food specials, but then again, none of the other bars around the ballpark have food specials. the menu is LIMITED to sandwiches, brats, burgers, and typical appetizers like nachos & wings. when i looked on their menu on-line, it was very different. the menu was much more extensive offering steaks, ribs, chicken, etc... but none of this was on the actual menu. this is why we went there, for the steaks. we got a 1/3 lb burger plate and a brat plate. the burger with cheese & bacon was $9.25 and had onion rings. the burger was no where near the stated 1/3 lb.  it was a dinky, crappy little burger. in my opinion, way overpriced for what you got. the brat plate was $6.75 or so. decent brat loaded with sauerkraut. however, the brat was suppose to come with grilled onions and beer battered sauerkraut. there wasn't a single onion on it and the kraut was very plain and i thought tasted bad. my side cup of potato soup was really good. all in all, i would not go here for the food. it's overpriced and not so great tasting. the drinks are priced well. it's a nice place to hang and have a drink. food, i would go to cooperstown."
"2","We were in AZ for Spring Training. If my husband wants me to go with him, I insist on staying at a nice resort. However, we were both disappointed in this one. Our king size room was of adequate size, but although there was ample room for a sitting area, there was only one chair plus the desk chair. The bathroom was outdated. If you want quiet, don't get a room facing the courtyard. There was noise at the pool and spa at all hours of the night including a raucous there at 4:00 AM! Didn't seem like management cared. First impressions with receptionist? Cold and all business which is efficient but not welcoming. Breakfast on site was expensive--I think they want you to buy the buffet, but we just don't eat $20 worth of breakfast food. We also dined at the Palm Court Restaurant which was overpriced for mediocre steak and dry salmon. Probably will not return to this place."
"1","I made a phone call to this postal office due to a package unable to be delivered because my address had been changed (which all my other mail was able to be forwarded). A man answered; I told him my situation and he placed me on hold for 8 min and then I was disconnected. I have been trying to call back and no one is answering. Great service (sarcasm)!"
"1","We were not impressed at all. We took the time to sit down with one of their accountants and explained exactly what we needed them to do for our businesses. Spent at least an hour and a half going thru everything and provided them with all the information they needed. They told us they understood and sold us on their services - but clearly they either didn't understand or were incapable of doing anything that didn't fit into their rigid structure. A quarter later we called to follow up and we got a \""I'm too busy for you right now\"" reply. Not cool. Three months after that we realized they weren't doing anything we asked and we tried to find out what happened. Instead of owning up to their mistake - they tossed insults at us and acted like our earlier conversation never happened! When we took our complaint to the owner we got a very robotic apology with no attempt to make things better. Clearly this company doesn't work well with others."
"1","went there for rear brakes on my pt cruiser for brakes drums and two new cylinders they wanted to charge me five hundred dollars yes five hundred for a brake job I told the guy I can,t believe he can look at me with a straight face and say that went to auto zone new brakes $20.00 life time warranty drums $20.00 a piece life time warranty two new cylinders $25.00 each and brake fluid total $137.00 wanted to charge me $60.00 each drum $140.00 for two cylinders and $$239.00 for brakes and fluid but they offer brake jobs for $89.99 what a joke cost me $239.00 for whole job paid neighbors son $100.00 to do the job stay away from these people no good !!!!!!!!! never will go back"
"3","I've only visited this thrift store once, but it's really quite nice. The prices are much higher than others in the area, but it seems a bit more selective in what it offers. I do plan to return."
"2","I went here with a couple of friends during Restaurant Week, and I have to say that I didn't LOVE it.  The menu was impressive with its edamame dumplings and teriyaki brown rice with tofu, but the food itself wasn't AWESOME.  It was kind of like, Ok.  I tried the place, but I'm in no rush to return anytime soon.  I also wasn't particularly impressed by our waitress.  She was a bit too perky and a bit too in-your-face about the greatness of True Food.  I love everything that True Food stands for, but there was something that was a bit snooty about the environment.  There was so much emphasis on the greatness of True Food that I was kind of turned off by it.  \n\nI will say, though, that the natural refresher drinks are really good.  I had the cucumber refresher with cucumber and honey lemonade.  Highly recommend.   Not too much cucumber taste and just enough honey lemonade that it wasn't too sweet.  Here's my overall rating:\n\nFood: Meh.\nPrice: Not awesome, but tolerable.\nParking: No problem.\nService: Not impressed.\nAmbience: A bit too trendy.\nChefs: Cute.\n\nAlso particularly questionable to me was: who the hell is Dr. Weil?  Where I come from, he's a foot doctor.  Apparently around these parts, he's some bigger dude that is qualified to discuss healthy living.  Hm..."
"1","If you are in search of good ole down home soul food Lolo's will be a disappointment to you.  I ordered the gizzard, rice, & gravy. The brown gravy had absolutely NO flavor to it. I never salt my food but I had to add salt & pepper to the brown gravy. Still, it was no help. The bland coating to the gizzards was not crispy. My boyfriend ordered the Baby Ray. He, too, said his brown gravy had no taste. His waffles had an unexpected cinnamon spice to them (which was not described on the menu). Coming from Georgia, my palate was very spoiled by all the southern cook'n restaurants I had to choose from. To me I cannot classify Lolo's as a soul food restaurant. It is a poor imitation. It is quite pricey as well. Lunch for two (2 entrees & 2 teas) was 32.00 (tip not included)."
"5","Pokey sticks! enough said."
"4","A description of a dish\n the Tower of London:\nIt begins with a battered and deep fried bun, then a battered and deep fried pickle, followed by a spicy battered and deep fried cheese stick. It then kicks into overdrive with two pieces of battered and deep fried bacon, which I believe there were two pieces inside each battered bacon delight. Finally you hit the battered and deep fried all beef patty, by this point you're ready to keel over. Of course there's another battered and deep fried bun on the bottom, but by the time you reach that you will have collapsed on the floor. And don't forget you still have your side of fries or sweet potato fries. Coupled with beer this dish is a masterpiece. \nOnce you get the t-shirt you can use it to roll up into a pillow and take a short nap."
"3","Very Good burger but overpriced.  The Counter is still Better!"
"5","Beautiful office & friendly staff. Great location as well, just a few blocks from my home. I have been seeing Dr. Schwartz at the Ft. Apache location since this past May when my Quad Screen blood test came back high risk for down syndrome. We first met w/ Olivia, a genetics counselor who explained to us all of our options. We then met w/ Dr. Schwartz. He was really nice, informative & answered all of our questions. We decided to do an amniocentesis since I was already well past 20 weeks. The procedure went by quick & hardly painful (I'm good w/ needles) but my anxiety was high. Thank goodness the test came back negative. I continued to see Dr. Schwartz every 5 weeks or so for ultrasounds so that can measure the baby & now I am going there on a weekly basis this last  3 weeks before my due date for baby monitoring. They are very thorough, organized & caring. You can also purchase a DVD of your ultrasound for $20 which we did in the beginning. I highly recommend Dr. Schwartz & Desert Perinatal & most likely will be going there when we decide to have our second child. \n\nThey also have Belly Bliss connected to them which offers pre-natal massages, etc. I haven't tried them yet although I do have a token for a free 20-min foot massage."
"3","Cameron Toll  is pretty rubbish really, but is dragged back from the brink by the Sainsbury's there, which is hee-owge. Outside it just looks like a 60s monstrosity that is waiting to be knocked down, for the good of humanity. Inside it is slightly less offensive, but there really is not much there, apart from the supermarket.\n\nYes there are a few chains, notably a relatively big W H Smith's, a New Look and a few travel agents, and the occasional 1 off store like Gimme Gizmo and Paperbox, but nothing else of value. There are a load of those stores that perpetually have a sale on, with everything either at least 70% off, or chucked in the bargain bucket. Really though, nearly all these shops can be found on Prince's Street or in the St. James' centre, which offers you a lot more alternatives as well.\n\nThe only real good point is the Sainsbury's, it is massive, and the only one within a reasonable distance from the centre, unless you want to faff about with a load of buses to get to Asda. For many of the students who live in Tesco Metro, this makes a nice change, as it is easy to get to and the quality and choice of food is infinitely better than Tesco. Unless you are here to do your groceries there is no real point so just head into town to find similar, but better shops"
"4","Food is alright. I go there for their Cable Cars!"
"5","casual atmosphere...with a foray of stocking and interesting people"
"2","My husband and I were craving some good pizza so we stopped by. I wish we had gone elsewhere. The service was okay, the pizza was terrible. Our waiter was fairly attentive, all of the staff was walking around with a purpose. The exterior was funny though there was an intense odor of some sort of sewer problem just right outside the door. Inside the restaurant was typical skater boy/psychedelic decor. Meh. Seen it. \n\nOnto the pizza. When it came out we were excited and starving; ready to dig in. The first bite was horrible. The crust was too thin, and there was more cheese on that pizza than any other pizza I've ever eaten. The toppings of the pizza were saturated in grease, I couldn't dab off enough. As we kept eating it got no better. I ate one slice. We had a large pizza. My husband ate one slice. When the waiter asked if we wanted to take it home we both said no way. \n\nNow the pizza was bad, but the price was worse. We spent $25 on two drinks, and a pizza of horrible quality. We will not be coming back."
"3","First off, my expectations were pretty high for those banana nut muffins.  I prefer mine with more nuts in them so they were just okay to me - I've experienced better and probably will not get them again.\n\nI ordered a scrambler and it was very good - the potatoes were okay - a little too much seasoning for me but they were crispy.  My grandma said the coffee was good and she enjoyed her corned beef hash.  The service was excellent, the prices reasonable, amount of food was a lot, and the atmosphere was good.  I would come back.\n\nOh, and free Wi-Fi which is great when your grandma you are visiting doesn't have internet."
"4","If you like hot dogs in the least bit, come here. There are 18 different dogs to choose from and if you don't find something that whets your whistle, make your own custom dog! With 6 different kinds of mayo, 21 toppings, 4 varieties of dawg, you can make magic happen. Be warned, the dogs are big. So even if you get one without toppings, it's still a meal. Don't miss out on the fries either. Toppings galore on those babies. \n\nI rocked an East Coast Dog (pastrami, kraut, tomato, buldogis mayo) on my last visit. The combo of pastrami and hot dog is phenomenal. The mayo sounds gross, but isn't your standard mayo, so don't be scared. It added flavor to bring the meats together. Great dog all around!\n\nI don't necessarily go out for hot dogs often. But when I do, I make it Buldogis."
"2","Nice place, the food though seemed amateur the side salads looked like I just dumped them out of a bag threw baby carrots and grape tomatoes on them. the crab cake was good but only one and poorly plated for 10 dollars though seemed like there should have been at least two of them. I had the herb roasted half chicken with wild rice and baby corn and more baby carrots. it was ok but not great. my friend had the 8oz filet with mashed potatoes baby corn and more baby carrots. the steak was not at all worth 25 dollars it was 2 pieces of meat they were tender but looked like pot roast.  So overall felt like i got ripped off and probably would just go back for drinks and maybe cheaper appetizers."
"2","This review is only for the pecan sticky bun and the country sourdough bread loaf. I wasn't greatly impressed with either. The sourdough did have a nice sour flavor but was too dense and hard. The sticky bun was good for the few bites with the syrup on top, but the rest was bland and doughy with not enough filling. \n\nThe guy behind the counter was very helpful and friendly. They have free wi-if and are open 24 hrs. Seemed like a nice place to hang out if you're so inclined."
"1","bad service, bad internet, bad employees at the store specially tempe market place ones they are worst customer service ever, dont go there......"
"4","My go to place for a delightful coffee. Had a chocolate brownie and a cappucino. Just loved it. However, coffee was much smaller for the price as compared to other coffee houses."
"5","This place was absolutely incredible.  I visited in late March, but it seems to be the kind of place that has a different style of beauty at different points.  I'll talk about my two favorite parts: the greenhouse gardens and the general gardens (specifically the 'rock hill garden')\n\nWalking into each greenhouse was like discovering a whole new world.  Ranging from tropical rooms covered in brilliant flowers and lush vines to a desert room with cactus.  My only regret is that I wasn't able to run around and frolic among the plants like a little kid.  I have to say my favorite greenhouses were probably 8 and 10.  8 had a ton of carnivorous plants and orchids (which are awesome) and 10 had an Amorphophallus Titanum, a plant that grows an absolutely gigantic flower. Unfortunately it is in the beginning stages of this years growth, but that's just an incentive to come back :)\n\nThe rock hill garden was both visually stunning and a great place for children to play.  While I was there, a wedding was being held and children were running around having a wild time.  If you have kids, take them here, they will love it.  From the top of the hill, you can see the Edinburgh skyline, complete with castle. \n\nTrust me its worth seeing."
"3","Was quite amazed that on a Friday night our receptionist told us the wait was about 10 minutes. Ten minutes later we were being seated at our table. Nice! After that it kind of went downhill. Took about 5 minutes for a waiter to get our drink order. He also took our meal order at the same time. We all were having the great $8.95 endless pasta. Now if you have been to O.G. you know they have great soup, salad. and breadsticks. We were very hungry and it took 10 minutes to get the soups,salad, and the breadsticks. The salad was way over dressed to the point it was soggy. The breadsticks were semi-hard. I don't know how that's possible when it's so busy in there, but what do I know? Anyways, we had our soups, and salad for about 3 minutes and the waiter brings out our pasta! Now the table is so overcrowed with dishes it's hard to eat. Now that was the bad. The good......well it's O.G. The pasta was on point. It was served hot and it was good! The great thing that our waiter did was to grind the cheese that they usually grind over the salad,soup,and pasta onto a plate. What can I say, I LOVE cheese and I had more than enough! I usually ask the waiter to grind cheese onto my pasta until his arm hurts. LOL. Well this new way I got to put as much(maybe more) cheese on my food. Great move!"
"4","I can't believe how great of a deal I got at this place. Not only did they highlight my hair and cut it exactly the way I wanted it, but I also got a free massage and smoothie while waiting for my foils to be done. \n\nPlus, it is a great opportunity for students to get some students and make some connections for future clients. You could say I am definitely a fan!"
"1","I went with my friend a month ago for a pedicure. A week later my big toe started to throb. I thought maybe I had bruised it? It still kept on bothering me and being on fire. So I took the nail polish off and GROSS! It was black!  I got a freaking nail fungus!\n\n I am highly upset that after all the years of getting pedis done, I try out this salon, and I get a lovely take home gift. I had to go to the doctor and she said I can take a pill that will damage my liver to remove it or get the \""nail polish\"" type prescription and it will take 6 months to get rid of it. Needless to say, I took the nail polish prescription. \nDON'T GO HERE UNLESS YOU WANT A NAIL FUNGUS TOO!"
"5","Best coffee shop in Madison by far!\n\nAlways impressed with the locally roasted coffee selections and the tasty seasonal drinks.\n\nAncora has drinks for the coffee snobs and the \""Grande Iced Caramel Machiatto\"" folks;)\n\nStop in, find something you like and support a local company that has been around for 15 plus years."
"4","This place is relaxing and beautiful hidden in the desert. Had Burgers and Wings while by the pool. The burgers were big and juicy like home made! 1st time to paddle board for $30 and pay only $20 for repeaters. The kayaks are free if you're a hotel guests. It's a great place for a weekend getaway!"
"4","3.5 stars but I'll round up.\n\nBeen here multiple times and never really had a bad experience. However, did have awkward experiences haha. \n\nMy first time was with bun and got my Rose MT. Pretty sweet where I could taste the rose so I was satisfied. But it was a little hard to concentrate when the cashier, with really big boobs, was taking our order. I looked for bun and me - sorry but they were huge lol. It was also a bit different with another waitress asking if I enjoyed my drink...when I have not taken a sip of it yet lol she was trying to be friendly, but I guess it felt a bit forced. \n\nOther times I went with bun and guy friends, bun made me realize that tipping there may only be for the experience - not so much the food. The popcorn chicken we ordered was dinky and more of like an appetizer size - costing $5.25, unfortunately it was very delicious, comparable to SF. The drinks also, are a bit pricey, small mason jar MT dine-in is about $5 I believe and with choice of syrup, it's around $5.50 - so a snack is as much as a drank lol\n\n^ going off of going with guy friends, this place is more of the experience not so much the food/beverages....\n\nAnd prepare to not cock-block your guy friends too when you go. Waitresses come to you less when a female is present lulz....\n\nreally. that wasn't my intention, guys. honest."
"2","If it were for the view and hype alone- 5 stars.  However, for the c-note per person average expense: the food and service left much to be desired.\n\nI am quick to judge an upscale restaurant on a simple rule: do they offer you a dark or light napkin depending upon your attire?  I was wearing a black dress.  Everything is white at MIX.  No offer of a black napkin.  Okay- that is my little hang up, but usually it is not a deal breaker.\n\nWe were seated in a lovely corner seat, but before we had ordered our wine, the hostess seated another party directly next to us (the tables were tight in and had to be moved to seat anyone in or out - so when I say 'next to', I mean literally 'on top of').  If it were a busy night, that would have been fine, but there were only a handful of tables occupied.  In fact, we were so close that when the palate cleanser came out - the waitress made a joke and served both our table and our unexpected dinner partners' together as if we were in the same party.\n\nThe servers were nice- but my plate was taken before I was done with my meal and water spots on our flatware were pointed out to us (seriously) and explained why they weren't dirty, it was just a chemical-reaction-but-here-is-a-new-spoon-anyway-even-though-you-didn't-ask.  Who knew there was flatware TMI?\n\nThe food was decent.  Our highlight was a phenomenal bottle of wine (very extensive wine list) and the ravioli appetizer - out of this world.  Our entrees?  Not bad, but nothing to write home about.\n\nWe went to MIX for a romantic Vegas evening.  It was definitely Vegas- but Vegas in the 'pot-bellied-balding-Elvis-impersonator' sort of way.  I wouldn't complain if it were my only Elvis sighting- but you know it doesn't live up to what is around every other corner.\n\nBut- the view was spectacular."
"1","Drove past this place a thousand times and finally we tried it.  Definitely NOT\nimpressed.  Ordered 1 bacon cheese burger with tomato, lettuce and onion.\nIt comes with a lot  of thousand island dressing.  So the bun was soggy,\nmy sweetie ordered a bacon cheese burger dry.  Catsup on the side and\none order of fries. $16 bucks.   I will take IN  and Out anyday.   In and Out  \nhas smaller portions but  I  don't know why but maybe it is because In and Out\nowns the bun and meat concessions and has a higher standard, no matter\nwhere you go for In  and Out its always good.  But eat it  quick because like all\nfast food its shelf life is very very short.  Be warned!"
"2","I went here for lunch with a client, expecting a lot.  I mean, It is Eddie's, and he has been around a long time.  I am sad to say I was quite disappointed in the food.  It was mediocre at best, and it was expensive for what we ordered."
"2","Okay well so many people recommended trying this place so it has to be good right? I will say the service was great. I hate to give bad reviews but our server said the best sandwich on the menu was the Pb&J burger. Stepping out of my comfort zone I decided to try it. I have no idea what I was picturing but I thought maybe they had a secret or something? It was literally a hamburger dripping with peanut butter & jelly with bacon. So messy! Every bite I took there was jelly and peanut butter dripping out getting everywhere and all over my hands. The taste was just very strange and didn't seem to work at all, at lease for me. It was Sooo sweet. Hate to say we took 75% of this one home to our dog.( He loved it! Lol) This review is really a review of the PB&J burger nothing else. Maybe we will try again sometimes bc the atmosphere was awesome and reminded us of being on vacation."
"2","I went within the first two weeks of their opening, so my experience may have been impacted by the new staff and such. Having lived in Texas for 10 years, I was super excited for Chuy's to come to town. It's impossible to find authentic Tex Mex in town, and our options for decent Mexican food are limited, too. So I had high hopes for Chuy's. But I was pretty disappointed by my experience and may not return to give it another try anytime soon. There were 4 of us in the party - 2 boys (10-12) and two moms. I ordered a margarita, and although it was $11, I found it to be VERY lacking. It was more like a watered down limeade. Pathetic. We each ordered a different entree, and nobody was very enthusiastic about their dishes. I had the enchiladas and was unimpressed. I think I've had better enchiladas at Chi Chis! Yikes. The service was slow and incomplete (requiring multiple requests before receiving things like salsa, fresh water, etc.)\n\nThe one positive to the experience is their house-made tortillas, which are yummy and fresh."
"5","Shanghai Angus Steak ROCK!"
"2","Invited by friends to go here for dinner on a Sat night and read all the Yelp reviews beforehand to try to get an idea of what food to order (most of the reviews don't really talk about any good/bad particular dishes).  The place looks old and outdated, especially for a hotel type restaurant.  We were seated out on a back side patio which was fine until BIG winged bugs arrived after we ate.  Anyway, the frozen margaritas were good and I ordered the Street Tacos, which were okay but the beef in them could not have been cooked anymore as it was tough and not very tasty.  Chips and salsa are pretty good.  Our group of 7 all ordered different things and no one had had rave reviews or bad comments about their dishes. We ordered flan, fried ice cream and sopapias (sp?) for dessert, which were all polished off.  I live in the Valley and given the multitudes of very good to great Mexican places we have, I don't need to return to Aunt's."
"1","Noisy bar not for dining"
"1","We have a group that meets monthly and have been to George & Dragon II one other time so we felt safe going back, but this time was like day and night. We got there early because we planned on having a dozen or so people there on a Friday evening, and there was a larger party in the back room. The other half of the room was empty so we asked to sit there. The waitress agreed so we took a seat. We asked for drinks which took a few minutes. Two friends came after we got our initial round, and they were ignored. The waitress seemed to be more interested in the larger group with the bigger tip. \n\nPart of our meeting dealt with being online since we're a technology education group, and we were blown off. Finally we were told that they no longer have wireless (which they use to \""share\"" with the hotel next door). This was really annoying, but we weren't offered any excuses or apologies. We put away our laptops and prepared to enjoy an evening of drinks and dinner. \n\nAfter an hour of literally not getting served (drinks or food), we waited for a table to open in the front. A few of our people were annoyed and left without ordering anything and another person was told not to bother coming. We finally got a booth out front and complained to the waitress there. She said the next round was on the manager, who she supposedly told about our unhappiness (but unsurprisingly, he never came over at all to talk to us). We got our free drinks and two of us who were famished were able to eat. \n\nAs soon as we were done eating, we got out of there and parted from the bust of an evening. We quickly removed George and Dragon II from our rotation of places for this meeting. \n\nFrom the fact this is has become a dive bar (absolutely NOTHING like the AWESOME George and Dragon I on Central), that the wait staff mostly sucks, and that they don't seem to care about customers, we are completely done with this place. DO NOT GO HERE."
"1","Stood at the door for 15 minutes with like 3 tables unbussed. No one hustling. Now sitting at the table with enough time on my hands to write this review. Pho is usually fast since the broth should all be prepared already. Not sure when I'm going to eat yet...just finally got my water after asking for it twice. So frustrated"
"5","I come here almost daily... Mainly to fulfill my slight addiction to Quest bars. In most cases you will find much healthier alternatives at this store than in any grocery store. The staff here is a lot like the staffs I encounter at most other hi-health stores around the valley, always friendly and helpful. Garrett, the manager here, knows his stuff!!!\n\nAlso noteworthy... Way better than One-Stop. No hassle here, only help, and much cheaper!"
"3","HUGE MOVIE SCREEN.\n\nThat's what you get for paying extra for the Cine Capri. You get what you paid for.\n\nOn a side note, I noticed that I eat the popcorn before the movie and not during the movie."
"5","This place is the bomb for acrylic nails!!!!! I found this little gem of a nail salon because of yelp and man were the reviews right on. The place is new, clean and very spacious compared to other nail salons. I moved to Phoenix 6 months ago which is when my search began for a local nail salon to have my acrylic nails done. I have tried several places and although I have had decent to good pedicures, I have never been happy with my acrylic nails....until now! Eric did a terrific job...he took off my yucky acrylic nails virtually painlessly which is no small feat and was meticulous every step of the way without me even asking. I honestly can't remember a time I have been so happy with my nails, even the polish was done with care, but he was still relatively quick. He also asked a few times along the way if I was happy with my nails which a lot of nail techs don't do. I can't comment on the pedicures because I haven't had one yet, but the chairs were pretty full and the other customers looked satisfied. A major plus is most of them speak pretty darn good English and they have tons of polish to choose from in lots of fun trendy colors. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place, my search for a terrific nail salon has ended as it doesn't get any better than this place!!!!!"
"4","bought a great couch sectional from the Town Center and 215 location.  Great deal!!"
"5","This is a great place for small kids. They have TV and bunch of movies.Kids can pick their movie and start watching when friendly staff they cut their hair. \n\nThe chairs are very custom made in the shape of plane, cars etc. \n\nIt's not expensive compared to other regular places.\n\nAlso their address in yelp is wrong. They are on 59th and 101 next to Albertsons."
"2","I had chosen this place for a birthday dinner. Had read slme reviews.  The guacamole was good but the other food wasn't what I expected.  I might have just been.setting up high expectations for the place. It was a good atmosphere and friendly staff but the food wasn't what I had in mind."
"5","Best pizza you can get in Arizona hands down. A bit on the pricey side, but you definitely get what you pay for! \n\nBuild your own pizza by choosing the size, sauce, and all the toppings. On our first try we had the red sauce with roasted red bell peppers and meatballs. The meatballs are sliced thin and have a great authentic flavor, while the peppers were out of this world, yet were a bit overwhelming in the sense that they dominated over all the other flavors. Not to mention the crust was to die for; thin and crunchy and cooked perfectly!\n\nOn our second visit we had another red sauce pie with meatballs, ricotta cheese, and mushrooms. The meatballs prevailed yet again, and this time we could really enjoy the amazing red sauce without the overpowering flavor from the red bell peppers. The ricotta is a MUST, and the mushrooms are a great veggie adding additional meaty consistency. \n\nThis venue is huge and we did not have any trouble being seated at lunch or dinner time. We sat in the outside courtyard on our most recent visit at lunch time, and it was very beautiful. I hope to sit there again after sundown to enjoy the lighting and romantic atmosphere. \n\nThis place is absolutely a must try for any pizza lover in the area!"
"1","Grand opening day.  Fryer wasn't ready, ribs not ready...and was disorganized in general.  Ordering food isn't easy as you order at the end of the counter but the sides are on the side of the counter.  Food was fair...  In general not well prepared for opening day."
"1","A group of 8 of us walked into Dave and Busters tonight for dinner and a little game play. I was happy to see that the dining room wasn't crowded with only one couple at a booth. We were greeted by an employee and in a less than charming voice she said, \""it's open seating.\"" We proceeded to enter the dining room and there was no visible seating for groups larger than 4, so we started to move and pull tables together while the staff did nothing to help. After all, they must have been very busy with that one table full of two people! \n\nThe waitress came around and took our drink orders. I was thrilled  to have learned that happy hour was until 7:30. I ordered a half priced very berry mojito. The drinks came, I didn't quite care for my drink, it was very very sweet. Almost like drinking koolaid. I was still in the drinking mood and was up for trying another half priced drink before happy hour was over, but our drink glasses sat empty for a long time with no waitress in sight. Our waitress finally returns from the abyss, asks two people at our table if they would like refills, and ignores the remaining 6 people. Really?! I was thinking this surely must be one of those 'What Would You Do?\"" shows, but unfortunately it wasn't and the lack luster service went on throughout the meal. \n\nSpeaking of our meal. We waited for what seemed to be an eternity for our food to arrive and when it did only half of us received our meals. The waitress got lost once again in the abyss during this time and drink glasses remained empty. Too bad because there would have been a lot more alcohol consumption.  I tried to be gracious and wait till my buddies got their food, but  I was starving by this point and dug in. \n\n I got the jack daniels chicken/power card combo. I asked to have the green beans, but was informed that they no longer served the green beans. Last time I visited, I had the green beans and they were well seasoned with just the right amount of crunch, tonight I was served a few different pitiful looking pieces of broccoli and carrots. The chicken was two paper thin pieces. I'm not exaggerating, paper thin! The mash potatoes were like wall paper paste! And they messed up two of the steak orders at the table. They were served very well done when the order was for medium rare. Also, I overheard  my friend comment that his steak tasted like saw dust. There were various mistakes with the other orders as well...wrong sides, etc. \n\nAfter the meal, we went to play the games. The games were fun and I thought of it as Dave and Buster's very clever way to have me forget about the gawd awful service and food I just endured. But all in all it wasn't fun enough to make me forget to post on yelp and warn my fellow yelpers! Eat somewhere else and visit here to  play the games after! You have been warned!"
"2","Food was ok at best. It was warm but not hot. The house fried rice was very bland and none of the meats were seasoned at all. For 8 dollars just for a plate of rice I could have done better at home. My boyfriend liked his Mongolian beef but my teriyaki chicken was very standard and nothing special. If you want better food and better prices go to golden Wei at bell and cotton"
"1","I just today visited this location and disliked the customer service.\n\nUsually when I'm here the customer service is fair with little or low expectation.  Today was the last time I'll ever come to this specific location again.  After being misheard 4 times in the drive through (very little traffic behind me mind you) the person taking my order finally gets it right.  \n\nWhen I reach the window he reviews my order again and STILL has it wrong (I am grateful that he checked).  I asked for his name and a customer service satisfaction number completed my transaction then parked in the lot.  \n\nThe number didn't go into an answering machine it simply went into a fax machine.\n\nNonetheless I took the corporate number and have complained.\n\nMy meal was fine but the experience here is ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE!\n\nBe cautioned when coming to this restaurant."
"4","Happy hour is from 4-6pm and the prices just cannot be beat! Just make sure to ask for the HH menu and you can't go wrong.\n\nYou don't have to worry about guessing whats in a roll since their menu's are very descriptive and the food does come out exactly as described, which is definitely a plus! \n\nWe started off with the Ahi Poke and Garlic Chicken. Both very flavorful and delicious! For our main entrees, we ordered the 808 special, Dragon roll, Tiger roll and Tempura roll. The sauce of the rolls is pretty good as its a combination of sweet with just a tiny kick! \n\nIt's also great coz aside from the HH, they have AYCE sushi! Lunch is $20.95 while dinner is $24.95. I would strongly suggest you go for the HH though, since for a party of 5 hungry people, our bill was only $55."
"3","This place has proper falafels. They are moist and delicious and If you get them in the wrap they are accompanied by yummy, pickles, beats, and other veggies. Don't forget the standard tehini sauce. It really is nice to get a proper falafel wrap.\n\nI tend to stick with falafel when I come here. Sure they have grape leaf wraps and some other ok vegan options but their falafel is way better than the other options. They have home made fries that tend to be a little hard and soggy. I don't think they pre-boil the spud strips before frying. Home made fries are always nice though, well usually.\n\nThe seating is a little sparse. There are not a lot of places to sit, inside or out. The out side seating is on a side walk but not a busy one and it is covered too, so that is nice. The inside is a little cramped. This is not a place for big groups. I would like to add though, they do have decent aesthetics inside so there are things to help your eyes wander around while you eat.\n\nThey service is usually very friendly though a little slow at times. It's not the kind of place you can swing by for a quick snack. However if you want a great falafel this is your place."
"5","Excellent and fresh sushi, great service and free wifi."
"3","i have had breakfast here 1/2 dozen times give/take the service has always been good except once and thefood is decent but never served hot its always warmish ........i could send it back i guess but its such a waste of my time to have to sit there for another 5 or so minutes while they reheat something that should have been brought out hot to Begin with they don't deserve 3 stars but 2 1/2 would be sufficient"
"1","The absolute worst pizza I have ever had the displeasure of eating. The soggy cardboard-like slab of \""pizza\"" looked like it's flavor would reflect it's appearance but I was wrong. It was completely flavorless and had the consistency of half-dry play-dough. The olives on my pizza fell off as soon as I picked the slab up to take a bite. I should've demanded a refund but was too disgusted to stay anymore. I was speechless and dumbfounded as to why this place had over 2 stars on yelp. The one star that I did give was oven because Yelp doesn't give me a 0 star option. Avoid this place at all costs."
"5","Usually when I think of a burger, I think of mediocre meat and lots of toppings to mask the crappy meat. Fits the craving sometimes, but just not a spectacular meal. \n\nTessaro's has defined for me a burger eating experience unlike any other. The meat they use here is awesome, both in texture and taste. I always order medium-rare.\n\nIf there's one place I'd take my out-of-town friends to eat, it would be here."
"3","I was in the mood for a good breakfast and couldn't wait to check out what they had on the menu. I don't see a lot of places that offer chicken and waffles so when I spotted that I knew I had to try it! When it came out it wasn't what I was expecting. The waffle was beautiful it  kind of looked like a flower but the piece of chicken was disappointing. I was thinking the chicken would be like a drumstick not a chicken strip. It wasn't about the quantity ...I just think that they taste different. I would have rather had chicken that had bones in it. It would give it more of a \""down home type of appeal\"". The waffle was fresh and I could tell that is wasn't frozen because it was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.\n\nI thought the restaurant's decor could have been brighter. If you are going for mustard yellow why not go a step above and make it sunshine yellow!  I just think a brighter yellow would remind me more of breakfast . What can I say I love bright colors! \n\nThe service was fine. The food came out in a timely manner and we didn't have to hunt down a waitress for refills. I just thought my entree could have been better ."
"4","How can you go wrong with anything at Pei Wei. I stop in here at least once a week to grab lunch and it's always been fresh, hot and quick. I love that they now have a smaller size portion of your favorite dish or the regular size. Even the small portion is a good size and I still usually have leftovers.\n\nDefinitely one of my favorites to head to for a good lunchtime meal."
"3","Came to this new establishment with friends on a Saturday dinner. The restaurant looks clean and bright--but with very few patrons--only about 5 tables of people showed up during the entire dinner time. \n\nAs many have noted, the menu is very eclectic, or in a big identity crisis. Burritos, cajun food, Chinese, and Sri Lankan cuisine on the same menu? I am not sure if I have seen such a menu anywhere else. \n\nOur conclusion is that the owner might have a very postmodern idea on what \""curry\"" means. Any creamy and liquid dish could be conceptualized as a type of curry--therefore the Southwestern chili and Louisiana gumbo on the menu! It suddenly makes sense! \n\nWe stick to the Srk Lankan dishes and ordered Pineapple Curry, Chicken and Potato Curry, Batu Moju (eggplants), and Kothu the weekly special item. \n\nThe biggest problem for KJ is the small portion. I was stunned to see the tiny portion of eggplants and pineapple curry. 5 of us each got one spoon of the dish, and that was it! The two dishes were definitely overpriced. Chicken and potat curry was pretty good, but too spicy (we ordered medium) for our group. \n\nThe sizes were also inconsistent. Kothu came with a decent amount and was the most memorable dish of the night. \n\nWe also ordered paratha after being told they have no naan or roti. It was very disappointing. I can make better paratha with the frozen ones from Asian groceries. \n\nKY failed to impress our group with its current style. We still had a good time trying Sri Lankan food, but we also all agreed that KJ should be a three star restaurant. With the same amount of money, you can easily get much better (and more) food in other places.\n\n I could see that, with some soul-searching, KJ could be a new gem in West Madison, but I am afraid it has to do it soon!"
"1","NOTE: The \""Poor\"" review/rating is only for John C. Lincoln Health Network - Saguaro Family Practice facility and staff and NOT for Dr. Mora whom our entire family loves. \n\nDr. Mora is our family doctor. Dr. Mora is incredibly knowledgeable, and getting an appointment to see him is very easy. When you meet Dr. Mora, he always greets you with a hand-shake and takes the time to sit down and actually talk to you about your healthcare needs. It is important to note that Dr. Mora has moved his practice location recently. \n\nDr. Mora used to be with John C. Lincoln Health Network - Saguaro Family Practice group located at 18404 North Tatum Boulevard , Phoenix, AZ 85032, (602) 992-1900. This John C. Lincoln group was atrocious! With the exception of Dr. Mora and his Medical Assistant Erica, the rest of the staff there were terribly rude. Not to mention the office was always filthy which did not make me feel very comfortable going there. (Also you should know that if you call the John C. Lincoln office where Dr. Mora used to work, they will NOT tell you that Dr. Mora has moved. Instead they will try and make you see one of their other doctors there, and I would not recommend any other doctor there to see.) So, I couldn't be happier that Dr. Mora has moved! \n\nDr. Mora now works for Scottsdale Healthcare Primary Care Paradise Valley, 5010 E. Shea Blvd., Suite D100, Scottsdale, AZ 85254, (480) 882-7420. This new location is the kind of doctor office you feel comfortable going to. It is very clean and the staff are very courteous and extremely helpful. If you are new to the valley or looking to change doctors, please consider going to see Dr. Mora at his new practice location. You will not find a better doctor in the valley than Dr. Mora!"
"3","We have a NEW Champion!!\n\nThis place was recommended for its sushi by a bus driver that I have come to know and HE NAILED IT!! A good sign I was in the right place was the amount of local Asians eating there.\n\nAfter eating Cali Rolls for months on end and NOT eating any for 2 months or so, I was \""Jonesing\"" for a fix and this place fixed me up good. They had a wide variety of rolls including spicy tuna, shrimp, eel, as well as rolls wt the orange fish eggs & various rolls wt spicy sauce. All were fresh and very good. The wasabi was kicking as well.\n\n Other stations offered your basic chinese fare such as brocoli & beef, whole fried shrimp, baked mussels wt cheese, Lo Mein, Fried Rice, sauted green beans, spring rolls etc.\n\nThere was also a station wt a chef to cook items to order & Tempura broccoli, sweet potatoes etc. And the price was right = $7.56 total. The desert offerings seemed kind of pedestrian & I grabbed a little muffin of some sort to eat on my walk afterwards & it was pretty good.\n\nThe location for me is kind of \""off the beaten path\"" but well worth a return trip and #1 as far as all the buffets I have been to yet for the variety that included sushi.\n\nI highly recommend it for Lunch."
"2","We stumbled upon this restaurant after finding out from the hotel concierge that the Domenco steakhouse was closed on Sunday afternoon. (the tour booklet says that it's open daily for lunch daily! This was confirmed when we later passed by the restaurant grrrr........)\n\nAfter our orders were taken, the waiter gave us breadsticks that were wrapped in plastic. I thought that was pretty tacky (?) and I expected better from a restaurant of MB. The bread was delivered not too long afterward, and fortunately, it made up for the boring breadsticks. \n\nI ordered the lamb pasta ($20), which tasted not too bad at first. The flavor was all right, and the pasta was cooked nicely (it had a bit of a chew to it, which I like). After eating mouthfuls of it, however, I got pretty sick of it. I started tasting a bit of a cheesy flavor to the dish, something I personally don't like in my pasta. I couldn't finish my food, so I gave the rest to my bf, who was kind of bummed about his veal meatballs. \n\nProbably won't come here again because there are way better Italian places in the LV strip. The view is nice, though. You might be able to see people performing at the center."
"2","Too much hassles with parking and why does every mall have those annoying Isreali women putting stuff on your hands. Also more annoying people trying to get you to donate and adopt some foreign kid and give away your money to who knows what company. Food court is too cramped and the stores are your average run of the mill junk with one exception on third floor being the Pepper palace. Tons of interesting sauces, salsas and powders up there and even a few guys whining after they tried the really hot sauce on display. Otherwise, you can find all this stuff without the hassles at any old mall in the area."
"4","It amazes me the upgrades they've made since moving to the area. A few things I've noticed:\n\n- flashier produce section (labeled and presentation upgrades)\n\n- a push for more organic and clean eating products available (they brought the fruit cutting and packing from the back to the front so you can watch the employees picking fruit... Oh and they make their own juices including pineapple, carrot and orange juices)\n\n-a larger gluten-free and \""paleo\"" centered selection of produce, meats (cage free and non-GMO available) and ingredients.\n\n- samples from the sushi bar\n\n- a huge variety of wines and spirits with local and out of state choices available\n\n- self check-out for convenience\n\n- a selection of \""as seen on TV\"" items\n\n- SLOTS (oh Las Vegas)\n\n...and more!\n\nI enjoy Smiths for most of my quick, last minute shopping choices (and with their discount card, you get $0.20 off gas for every 100 points earned at the Fabulous Freddy's gas status conveniently located behind the store). The variety of choices gives everyone a chance to find what they need while the store is conveniently open 24/7. Some of the down falls I've noticed was in the occasionally grumpy employee (cashiers mostly) and a rather crowded layout making it hectic with traffic during peak and busy days/hours.\n\nOverall, I enjoy this location and the sushi bar is pretty awesome for store bough, cold sushi :)\n\nI have four stars"
"3","I've taken things here a few times over the years. It's in a convenient location, the staff is friendly, and the clothing always looks great. My big issue is that the employees stand directly outside and smoke. This looks awful and smells awful- especially when it blows in the front door choking you while you wait in line. I have no idea how they manage to keep the clothing from reeking (or maybe I've just gotten lucky). I could certainly come here more than I do, but I despise walking through a cloud of smoke every time."
"2","Food trucks have become a huge trend these days, but I'm not one to fight lines and hunt them down around town. I'd much rather go to a fixed location and order something whenever I want, which is why I had to take a trip to Slidin' Thru HQ to see if the sliders in their restaurant are any better than the ones on their truck. Simple answer: nope.\n\nThe HQ is located near the airport in an odd office park. There's a bar next door to it that's very easy to find because of all the signage, but the HQ has nothing but a sticker in the window so my friend and I drove by it twice. Maybe they don't want to be found even by those trying to look for them? The interior of the place is something out of a comic book, insane colors, loud music, and comic book style art spray painted all over the walls. It wasn't too bad, but the seating choices were quite limited. I think there were two booths that could seat about six, a round table with a few chairs, and a long high top table with maybe another 8 chairs or so.  Not sure what they do when there's a rush, although based on the location maybe there never is...\n\nFor the sake of variety and hoping I would hit the jackpot with at least one decent slider, I ordered three different kinds from a selection of six Angus sliders, a pulled pork slider, an eggplant option, and a 'mystery' selection.  They also offer four different kinds of Super Fries with all sorts of insane toppings, as well as regular and sweet potato.\n\nThe first one up was the Barby, which has melted cheddar, caramelized jalapenos, crispy fried onion strips, bacon and bbq sauce. Quite a lot of toppings for a little slider so I expected much flavor, but what I got was A LOT of dryness.  The word 'dry' is going to become a common theme here I should mention. The bun on this slider was extremely dry and a bit hard, but the meat was beyond dry. Luckily(?) the onions and bbq sauce completely consumed all flavor of this concoction, so I was a bit distracted from the dryness by the taste of a bad version of KC Masterpiece sauce. Strike one.\n\nThe next one up was the Captain's Order, complete with roma tomatoes, arugula, bacon, feta cheese, saut\u00e9ed onions and a balsamic reduction. Once again the bun and meat were beyond dry, but lucky for me this time the balsamic commanded all flavor. The bacon had decent flavor, but was totally overcooked and, you got it, dry. Not much else to say about this one, just underwhelmed again. Strike two.\n\nMy final attempt at decency came from the Pep Pep, which the guy behind the register described as an 'In-N-Out clone'. This one has lettuce, tomato, pickles, bacon, saut\u00e9ed onions, cheddar and super sauce. There are few burgers out there that are even close to being as good as the Almighty, but I must say that this one was good. I only wished that I had ordered three of them. Upon my very first bite I exclaimed that it actually tasted like a burger. The pickles were good, the bacon was ok, and the meat somehow retained some moisture this time. The meat on its own had ok flavor, and I was happy I ended on this one and not the others.\n \nAs for the fries, I went with the Barby Fries which are a play on the Barby slider. That was a bit of a mistake, if you're getting a few different kinds of sliders here, try to get one of the fries based on a burger you're not getting for some more variety. Or, if you're not looking to order a giant bucket of fries for $5 that are more than enough for 3-4 people, try the regular or sweet potato choices. The fries are not too bad on their own, but layered with melted cheddar, bacon, caramelized jalapenos and bbq sauce they become something totally different. They get soggy very quickly, and the sauce overpowers all flavors once again. The onions taste good, very reminiscent of a Bloomin' Onion if you've ever dared to order one. The bacon bits were overcooked and had a burnt grease flavor, the jalape\u00f1os tasted good but were buried in the rest of the flavors.\n\nMaybe the most acceptable part of this meal is the price for three sliders: $7. I think it's very reasonable if you could get three that aren't dry that you might actually like, but once you combine that with $5 for the insane Super Fries and a drink, it quickly becomes a $15+ meal which is a bit steep for this. The fries are more than enough to share with a few people so you could split the cost with a few other folks, otherwise I would stick to the regular fries for a much more reasonable $2. \n\nOverall I fail to see what all the hype is about. Sure the food truck thing is cool, but unless you can actually deliver a good product like some other folks I don't know what to tell you. The interior of their HQ is probably cool if you're in high school, but if you're looking for a decent place to sit down and get something slightly better than fast food you should probably skip the HQ."
"3","3 1/2 stars.\n\nNot a bad place for ramen considering we folks here in Las Vegas are severely limited with authentic ramen choices.  Call me old school, but I still have the idea the best ramen joints ever are the ones where it's a huge hole-in-the-wall.  Not catering to anyone, but being able to knock your socks off with a simple bowl of noodles and broth.\n\nI hate to say it but Anime Ramen is a bit gimmicky for my tastes.  Sure, I guess it's cool to have little Asian girls trot around in their form-fitting cosplay outfits, and have various anime posters all around.  But for me it takes away from the experience of a true bowl of ramen.  Ramen to folks in Japan is simple, comforting, and in many ways an art form.  The ingredients used to make your broth, the way you make your noodles so they have the right chew, and the additions you add to your bowl are supposed to evoke zen-like feelings when all is done correctly.  Well, that's what I hear anyway.  The environment at Anime Ramen just kinda distracts me from trying to enjoy my bowl of ramen!  \n\nI'll give the cosplay girls credit though, they do a good job with service.  Attentive, kind, and pretty on point.  No complaints there.  But the food just didn't leave any kind of lasting impression on me.  It was ok, nothing special to me.\n\nI tried the shoyu ramen that night.  For $8 I thought it was a bit on the skimpy side, the bowl was small!  I really wish there was more noodles for me to slurp up.  The broth was rather bland for my tastes.  I didn't get much of a shoyu flavor, or a deep broth flavor of any kind for that matter so it left me a bit disappointed.  I added extra soy sauce to the bowl and it tasted a bit better but still not good enough.  Maybe the broth could have used more beef or pork bones?  Perhaps more bonito?  Or maybe even a dash of MSG?  I dunno, it just wasn't that great for me.\n\nI also tried the teriyaki chicken rice plate.  That was ok too, not the best teriyaki but not the worst.  Chicken was on the small size of portions (I am over 200 pounds people!), but at least the rice was good and the veggies were cooked just right.  \n\nThere are other things to try on their little menu, various other ramen bowls, teriyaki dishes, a few salads, and appetizers including teri sliders and furikake fries which I've heard are very good.  And nothing over the menu is $10 or so.  Value wise it sounds good, but man do those portions seem small!  This place is great for you lighter eaters.\n\nMe thinks that you are unfortunately paying for the anime-themed ambiance.  I place way more stock in the quality, quantity and taste of your food.  Size matters!"
"3","The food was great, but wasn't good enough to make up for the service."
"2","So so. Don't have salmon quarter pounder. Too little for too much money. Lettuce wrap or protein style not possible. Burgers are ho hum. There are better burger places."
"3","OK I am reading alot of good reviews about the Sandbar and I love the atmosphere. But what happened to the food?  Got the Mexican Cobb with the mixed greens. Since when was iceburg lettuce considered mixed greens? Oh well it was good at least.  My friend got the turkey melt with cold hard bread that banged the plate. And the fries were not only cold but hard and hollow on the inside. How can you mess up a french fry?  I have to admit I hardly ever complain but with food like that I will have a hard time coming back for more.  Sorry Sandbar, please kick up the menu for yummy treats and I would like to give you another try."
"2","I received a coupon for a $10 test drive and thought I'd give it a shot.  You get to try each of the 4 levels of beds they have within a 7 day period. I know tanning is bad but I rarely do it and didn't want to get burned on an upcoming beach trip.\n\nMy trial went really well until the final day when the girl didn't do a good job of recommending the time for a brand new level 3 bed which left me completely burnt. This is my health we are talking about here and all she was concerned with was selling me a package. \n\nDay 1 - I signed up and was talked into buy lotion even though I had some. My own fault but from then on, the girl was beyond nice to me.  I tried the level 1 bed for 7 mins. After my face a slightly red but nothing major. \n\nDay 3 - I tried the level 2 bed and the same girl was nice enough to recommend I try 8 mins but cover my face if it starts to feel hot. I did and i ended up with a little but of redness on my chest as well but again nothing major.\n\nDay 5 - I walked in and the place was packed. After waiting for 10 mins, I decided I would run some errands and stop back after. When I got back, all the level 3 beds were full so I did the level 4 bed. She recommended since I was red at 8 mins in the level 2 that I try 7 mins in the level 4 bed. It worked out perfectly. i covered my face and chest when they started to get hot like she recommended and came out with out any redness. \n\nDay 7 - My last day. since I had not tried the level 3 bed that is what i had left to do. This time it was a different girl. I told her i wanted to do level 3 and that 7 mins in the level 4 was fine but 8 in the level 2 was too much. So would 7 mins in the 3 be okay. She asked how i liked my lotion and if i wanted to try anything else. Then tried to sell me a package. I told her i wanted to think about it and she was quick to say okay your set in room 3. This is where everything went wrong. I left the salon feeling okay but with in hours could tell I was burned. Besides my face and chest where i had covered it part of the time I was completely burnt. You can completely tell where the bed does not get like my sides were not red at all. The issue with paying your staff on commission is that customer service often goes out the window when all they care about is selling. But I take great offense when my health is jeopardized because of someones carelessness. \n\nNeedless to say I wont go back."
"2","Went here on a Saturday night. I like the atmosphere! Loud J-pop music in the background and movies playing on the big screens? Interesting touch. I thought it was a smart move to add the subtitles for those that wanted to watch the movie playing on the big screen. Always something to look at in there whether it's the anime posters on the wall or the maids, I give the owners props for coming up with the unique experience. \n\nBoyfriend and I ordered from our waiter who seemed nice enough. I ordered the Teri Chicken because I was a little nervous in trying the ramen because of all the talk going around on how bland and terrible it was. Maybe next time. My boyfriend ordered Tom Yum ramen. \n\nFood came out at an understandable time. Not crazy busy, but not dead either. The Tom Yum was awfully bland; noodles were overcooked; and tasted watered down. (yes we leeched off of each other's meals to taste) The portions were good. As he calls it, it was \""edible\"".\n\nMy Teri chicken came with two rolls of crabmeat sushi. Unexpected, considering it came with a light salad, rice, and chicken. Normally when I eat sushi, I would like to eat at an actual sushi restaurant. It was a nice surprise and surprisingly good, fresh. \n\nAlthough the presentation was lovely and neatly arranged, the dish's salad was raw with hardly any of the vinaigrette. When I did get what was little of it mixed with a bit of salad, it was delicious. I just felt it was raw veggies tacked on there with the skimpy vinaigrette. Is this what I paid for? The rice tasted a little stale and warm,  and the chicken was unspectacular. It's a usual dish with quality you can find anywhere. It was okay, but I was expecting to be wowed a little bit. \n\nOur waitress seemed upset and very timid. We would thank her for setting down our food or thank her getting us the napkins they may have forgotten earlier, and she would walk away without one word or even smiling. It felt unwelcoming. It must have been a long day, I guess. I liked our waiter much more because he was polite. Both seemed inexperienced though. Not a huge deal, but nobody really checked on us unless we waved them down. \n\nWe are not picky eaters (far from it!), but when we go out to eat, I expect it to be better quality food than what I make at home. Food was decent enough to eat, but not enough to recommend. It was an okay experience. However, the service and quality of the food really detracted from it. It is going to take more than gimmicks and adorable dress-ups for us to come back though. I want to be convinced into coming back or to feel that it was so great the first time that I'd want to come back again. I would give it another chance maybe on a different night. And maybe when I forget about the meh service and mediocre food I had here."
"5","Love coming in to visit at Eddie's and the flavors - OMG, taste bud blowing experience. Thanks again, Eddie!"
"5","Wow! How did I not know about this place before now? Coconut's Fish Cafe is a surf-style eatery with surf board tables and benches. There is outdoor seating as well, but you order first from the counter and then they bring the food to your table. They have casual food like fish tacos, fish burgers, fries, onion rings, veggie burgers, etc. \n\nI ordered the fish burger and you can choose between 2 or 3 types of fish and what style you'd like it (spicy, salt and pepper, blackened, etc.) I opted for the mahi mahi, spicy style. It was a good size for a little over $10 and topped with a tomato and their signature coleslaw.  Sides are extra. Very messy to eat, but so, so delicious. My one negative comment was that the fish was slightly overcooked, but it didn't stop me from inhaling the whole thing. \nMy husband got the fish tacos. Also very, very messy to eat but super tasty.\n\nThe staff was genuinely friendly for a place that you order at the counter. Dogs are not allowed on their patio, just an FYI. And I wouldn't recommend this as a first date spot or anytime you want to be \""neat\"" with your food. Be aware, you'll get some on you."
"4","Stayed at the signature sweets this past March and the place was impeccable. We had a corner suite on the 19th floor. What an amazing view! The room was huge with a full kitchen (pots and pans available at the front desk) two bathrooms, both with beautiful glass showers and the one attached to the bedroom included a jacuzzi tub, THREE sinks and two vanity areas. Lots of space for everyone to get ready and if you happen to be staying for a while, theres no reason you won't be comfortable kicking back at the hotel for a few hours each day. Plus we had access to all of the pools (5-10 i lost count including an adult area at mgm grand) even at the MGM Grand, all of which included outdoor bars. We really enjoyed our stay there."
"4","SCORE!! A new fav to add into my rotation. I saw this place a fee times and the name always threw me off and didn't really know what to expect. Did some lovely yelp research, and decided to check it out. Love this place!! Tv's everywhere. Bar and both seating area. Its not a normal loud bar..there were families eating here with younger kids also to even older couples getting their grub on.\nOkay so the bbbeeeerrrrrrr!!!! Huge list of drafts that change constantly also . I had never had do many choices of IPA's!! You can create your own beer sampler. I made an,ipa sampler of four beers( ok I lie we made two samplers each ) we tried everything that sounded good. The menu is nice as well...everything from fried pickles to hummus to fish n chips... I actually had all three of these items and finger licking good.\n\nCheck this place out...you will dig it if you dig variety in your beer!"
"5","Ordered the breakfast special for the day- a Tex-Mex skillet with chorizo ($7.99, add $.99 for chorizo).  The chorizo was freshly made in-house, and tasted delicious.  Having made chorizo from scratch myself, I appreciate the effort and the right combination of spices it takes to make a good batch.  It was the perfect mix of spices and saltiness.  The skillet came with a hearty portion of potatoes, veggies, sour cream, and cheese, and looked excellent presentation-wise.  Service was excellent like last time, and the young gentleman here (Maybe the manager or the owner?) stopped us as we were leaving to thank me personally for my Yelp review.  Upgrade one star!"
"2","It is a beautiful restaurant with lots of staff, but provides a mediocre dining experience.   We waited for over 45 minutes between the first course and our entrees and had to beg for water.   The lamb chops were mostly fat and everything else was extremely salty.   We couldn't wait to leave.   Oh, and prices are ridiculous."
"3","I was getting married in Vegas. I was getting married in the Chapel in the Clouds at Stratosphere so I decided to stay in the hotel for convenience sake.\n\nThe rooms were inexpensive and clean. I don't have high expectations given the price. The toilets are scary. Don't do a courtesy flush unless you want to risk having your insides sucked out through your bumhole.\n\nThe unlimited tower admission seems like a pretty good perk for staying here.\n\nThe pool was adequate but they really should have built this on the ground floor so that the buildings shield you from the wind.\n\nCleaning staff were excellent. They were careful not to bung up or throw out your stuff and they did an overall good job.\n\nThe casino is ok. I wish they opened the tables in the pit near McCall's on more than just the weekends. Younger dealers tend to be more fun to play with. They're also friendlier than some of the old-fogeys running the tables on the other side.\n\nWifi access wasn't too bad but I disliked having to re-authenticate every 24 hours.\n\nThe tower shops are kind of a ghost town. Food, like McDonald's, is about the only thing you go there for.\n\nLike almost every hotel in Vegas, they have the dreaded resort fees. You get charged this whether you use their amenities or not. $15/day for this one.\n\nBecause of the location, you lose most of your savings by taking extra cab rides. If you have a car or don't mind public transportation, then it's not too bad.\n\nIf you're on a bit of a budget, stay here. If you're not, then don't."
"1","The staff is rude, and they were out of a lot of bagels everything by 1pm. I would not come back again, ever."
"3","Salad bar is amazing, meat is so so. They have a great selection but for the price not sure if it is worth it. Maybe once in a while for a special event..."
"4","This was the first time that I had gotten Dim Sum in Vegas, as normally my family and I frequent buffets and other things that Vegas specializes at that my hometown of Salt Lake does not.  As dim sum offerings are not as common where I'm from, I was very surprised to find a place that would offer full cart service on a Thursday afternoon around 2 o'clock.  \nWin.  \n\nWhile this wasn't the best dim sum I've ever had, it did have a really good selection.  I didn't love the siu mai or the chicken feet, but the shrimp hargow, the baked char siu bao, and the rice flat noodle with beef and/or shrimp were very tasty.  I'm not much of a fan of fried dim sum, so I didn't really try any of those offerings, but what I did try was pretty good.  \n\nI was also pleased with the ample parking, the service (which was not that bad), and the fact that I came in with half of a party of 9 and they still insisted on seating us right when we got there.  I still have yet to try other dim sum offerings in Vegas, but this was not a bad start!"
"1","The owner of this place should do everyone in Dilworth a favor and sell it to someone who actually knows how to run a sports bar."
"2","Here currently for breakfast, ordered lingonberry Bfast and chorizo hash--\n\nWe've had a fair share of Bfast check ins at different places so we're hoping to really have a good experience here.\n\nFood is underwhelming, blintz (pancake) is very very heavy. Servings are quite small compared to say IHOP or Mr.mama's or egg works. \n\nFood service is ok, nothing spectacular. \nAt the end of day, my husband and I both agreed -- we are not coming back. \n\nDidn't finish our food, going home disappointed."
"5","Far and away my favorite bar in Pittsburgh.  The food is incredible (the hot roast beef sandwich with homemade red skinned mashed potatoes is my favorite) and the drinks are ridiculously cheap.  The staff is always super friendly.  Plenty of TVs for watching the Steelers.  I have been coming here for years, and having moved to LA last year, I miss Nadine's more than anything else in Pittsburgh. \n\nI couldn't ask for more from a bar than Nadine's."
"4","Nice clean hotel with good amenities.  they even drive you to your room on a little cart.  the pool is awesome and their hot tub is practically the size of the pool.  24 access to pool and workout room.  totally great.  The best part about the place is that you can see wild rabbits hopping around all the time.  downside- you have to pay for wifi every 24 hours.  wish it was included."
"1","I dislike this place, first and last time I come here.  It's sad seeing people standing around talking and on their cell phones.  Placed my order and when I got my burger, it was all wrong. I waited an extra 25 minutes for my fixed burger. Not cool. Never again."
"4","Les apportez-votre-vin qui valent le d\u00e9tour pour leurs cuisine sont rares et m\u00e9ritent d'\u00eatre signal\u00e9s. \n\nLa carte est vari\u00e9e sans \u00eatre pl\u00e9thorique, et les entr\u00e9es comme les plats principaux sont ma\u00eetris\u00e9s et joliment pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s.

"1","i walked in with my gf @ 9:15 on saturday night, ready to try this place out. i had heard some good things. there were 2 tables of people eating/drinking and one table finishing up. we saddle up to the bar, waited for a few minutes longer than we would have liked but nonetheless a waitress walked up to the bar only to NOT acknowledge us, grab four empty glass and casually waddle back to the servicing area. she then proceeded to do something other than even speak to us to let us know she would be back to take our order...im mean nothing, the height of rudeness. we waited for her to see us getting up and walked right out of that b!tch. i highly doubt i would ever go back unless someone i trust pleads with me to try it again. too bad to b/c we just moved onto their FN street. poor show frans, supremely poor show...booooooooooo!!! ::sticks tongue out like a little baby::"
"4","I absolutely love vintage! The downside is that it can get pretty pricey at the normal shops I go to. The prices here were unbelievable. I couldn't believe my eyes. Vintage that's actually affordable! I was so thrilled.\n\nThey have tons of adorable household items, accessories, clothing, and shoes. The only bad thing I have to say is that there aren't very many choices in clothing for small girls like myself.\n\nI am very petite and it seemed that almost all of the clothing was medium and up. I was only able to find one shirt in my size. That's the only reason I'm knocking down a star.\n\nIf they carried smaller clothing I would frequent it more. For now I will have to keep on visiting my normal vintage store that has more size variety. I guess I will have to get lucky when I visit here but price wise and quality, this is the store to come to. Totally awesome!"
"1","This review is for SERVICE only and based on our last experience this past Saturday. \nBeing Vegas residents and this being my husbands favourite chocolatier in the world, we visit it about once a month. In the past decade we have probably tried everything on the menu! Needless to say the only reason we keep going back is because we love their creations.\nOn Saturday we were there with our 5 yr old son who is highly allergic to nuts. As precaution and matter of habit, every time we are in a restaurant we ask if his food contains nuts. We did the same at JPP (and this is not the first time we've taken him there). We got him a chocolate mousse looking thing (the patisserie shelves were almost empty and some items did not have any name-tags on them) and while placing the order asked if it had any nuts. The supervisor says, \""we don't guarantee anything\"". That's the strangest answer I've ever heard. Well, no one one this planet can guarantee anything, but since the pastry doesn't have a name-tag and since you guys have made it can you perhaps tell me if it has nuts? Now the guy gets extremely irritated and tells us in a curt tone, \""no, it has no nuts, but we cant guarantee anything\"". Needless to say we were very upset by his attitude but not wanting to disappoint a 5yr old we got him the mousse and left. This has to be the first time in 10 yrs my husband left without getting a crepe or some chocolate dessert for himself."
"1","Le-CRAP!\n\nThis is really the only negative review I have for food establishments our whole 5 days in Vegas, so that is pretty good.\n\nWe had lunch here today. I ordered French Onion Soup and a Caprese salad. The man had a French Dip with French fries. \n\nThe soup was ok. Broth was a bit off tasting but we couldn't pin point why. The caprese salad was awful. So bad that we both agreed to not eat more and to send it back. It was served with both red and yellow tomatoes and only 3 slices of mozzerella. Kind of stingy for this kind of salad, but it was the tomatoes that killed the dish. They were not ripe and they were so cold they were hardly edible even if some of them would have been ripe. The sandwich was cafeteria fare at best, but what clinched this place as going on my shit list was the service. \n\nI have a long list of jobs I have held in my time. I will not go through the list here, but know that jobs that revolve around food and customer service are on said list. This being said, our waiter did not come back until we were blatantly waiting for the bill/some acknowledgement. When I told our waiter the salad was \""not good because the tomatoes were not ripe\"", he told me \""the salad does not come with cooked tomatoes\"". I told him he was not understanding what I was saying, that I was saying that the tomatoes were \""NOT RIPE\"", he then told me \""well, that is how this salad comes\"". I told him not to argue with the customer and to take the salad off of our bill. Needless to say, this was a first for me. I totally stiffed him on any kind of tip what-so-ever and a little part of me wished I could have skipped out on the whole bill all together.\n\nDo yourselves a favor....don't eat here!"
"4","What a nice find--True TEXAS BBQ!!!  We placed a to-go order for our family visiting from out of town.  We ordered at the restaurant since we were new and needed recommendations, but probably preferred to do online or over the phone.  Also \""pre-ordering\"" will probably guarantee ordered items not to be 86ed.  We placed the order for 12 people, about $150 total, food was excellent, wonderfully packaged, and provided all utensils. What a class act.  We had plenty of food and left overs.  Next time we are all in AZ, this will be our go to take-out.  Here's the down-low:\n\nMeats: Rich brisket, tangy dry rubbed ribs, juicy pulled pork & shredded BBQ-beef, and my fav, length wise cut sausage!!!  So good!!\n\nSides: pickles, pickled peppers & carrots, creamy potato salad, sweet cole slaw, corn on the cobb w/ melted butter, spiced-BBQ beans, sliced bread, a gallon of fresh tea & sliced lemons and a jar of BBQ sauce.\n\nUtensils: thick picnic table designed napkins, strong cutlery, serving tongs (worth washing and reusing), sturdy disposable plates, plenty of extra travel sized BBQ sauce."
"5","Just moved to the area and searched for a good place for pho. Stopped by and were pleasantly surprised.  The eggrolls hands down are the best we've ever had. Served them up with plenty of lettuce and herbs just the way we like it. The pho was good but nothing amazing. I had the curry chicken and was pleasantly surprised at how good the flavors were. Curry with just the perfect hint of sweet, so yummy! We will definitely be back! Don't judge a book by it's cover, this place is great!!!"
"3","Uninspired bland sports bar. It has a very stupid name, it's weirdly laid out, the waitstaff are joyless zombies, and it has a surprisingly small beer list, but the food is good and served quickly. It has the advantage of being the only restaurant within 2 miles of the adjacent hotel."
"2","I am the biggest fan of Bouchon Bakery. Their food is high-quality, unique, and very decadent. However, when dining at the Bouchon Restaurant at Venetian, I was disappointed in my meal and will not be returning.\n\nThe staff was nice, as expected at a higher-end brunch spot. However, the food is incredibly sub-par. My party ordered: \n-Cobb Salad: completely ordinary; the chicken was fairly dry, the dressing was very standard, as if out of a bottle; the avocado was extremely limited, and the portion was quite far from generous (even for a higher-end restaurant)\n-Mixed Greens Salad: once again ordinary\n-Fruit Salad: fresh fruit, can't go wrong!\n\nUnfortunately, the food did not spark my interest at all. And despite the polite staff, their menu was below expectations."
"4","A decorative set piece of hops intertwined with fairy lights, a hearty selection of hand-pump ales and an arrangement of copper lanterns and  more tavern related paraphernalia ensures the Malt and Hops certainly looks the part. \n\nGreat beer and friendly staff back up the idyllic image, though, and smack bang in the middle Leith Docks results in a reliable prospect for a sociable drink.  A good place to go with you beer loving dad, as I once did."
"4","First, a shout out to Yelper Daniel R. for recommending this on the talk boards! I got to town a couple hours before my boyfriend and had some time to kill. This was a great place to do it. Though I didn't get totally zenned out, I did have a nice time chilling in the shade and feeding the fish. \n\nThey're charging $5 now (with a minimum of $10 on a card--so I picked up a tee). Fish food is 50 cents and worth it. \n\nThe park is smaller than I expected. I grew up in DFW and the fantastic Japanese Gardens in Fort Worth spoiled me a bit. I also hated that the office buildings eclipsed the views in some places. But the fish were super-hungry and fun to watch and the waterfalls were pretty. It's small though--I saw one woman lap it a couple of times; maybe not a bad idea. All in all, it's a nice spot for reflection and a good first stopping off place for some tranquility in the city."
"5","Amazing. Simply ahhhhmazing. Josh, who does bass, blows your socks off. I would go see this every week if I could."
"3","I stopped at Fernando's during lunch time on a Friday.  It was bustling like many of the places downtown during lunch.  There was a line like expected, but it moved very efficiently and the people behind the counter were direct, but not in any way rude.  They ask if you want all the normal toppings in a nice way and didn't seem to mind many people not wanting different toppings.  The place was tidy and what'd you expect out of a sandwich shop.\nNow the food.  They have a daily lunch specials that make a sandwich a \""meal\"" by adding a fountain drink and a bag of Herr's chips.  I ordered the Sante Fe Steak Taco wrap and allowed them to put everything on it that they normally do -- tomatoes, black olives, mild peppers, lettuce, steak, and cheese.  Next time I think I will opt for jalapenos.  The wrap was toasted, but was really soggy and did not end up looking anything like the pictured wrap, man that pictured wrap looked so toasty and delicious.  My wrap was good don't get me wrong, but I was hoping for more.  It was a good size for a good price and they throw in any dipping sauce you want, I got their house Southwestern.  I really liked what I saw from the subs coming out for other people, so I will go to Fernando's again soon and grab a sub.  Maybe I'll even update update my rating.  \nAgain it's losing stars only for the sogginess.  Go check out Fernando's to replace your Subway or Jimmy John's sub.\n\n***Edit***\n\nOrdered the Bacon Beef and Cheddar toasted sub.  It was good, but again just not great.  I still prefer Fernando's over DiBellas, Jimmy Johns, and Subway as far as sub places downtown.  It just falls short when stacked up against other sub places."
"4","Tooo much food.  Can't... breathe...\n\nI'm not sure if it was just our wonderful hyper foodie waiter, or if they treat all their customers this way, but dinner became an EVENT.  He insisted that every dish was bottomless. \n\nWe did the Classic Family Dinner:\n\n3 Appetizers:\n   - Spinach & Artichoke al Forno - Very rich, creamy, and flavorful\n   - Sausage & Peppers - Delicious, but why is this an appetizer??  \n   - Bruschetta - Great flavor, but eat it fast or the lovely buttery bread gets soggy and ruins the fun.\n*BONUS App compliments of the chef for being a new customer?*\n   - Crispy Zucchini Fritte -  How on earth did they make it so breaded and crispy?  I make fried zucchini all the time and it never turns out this good...\n\n4 Main Courses: \n   - Beef Tenderloin Medallions - FANTASTIC!  It was served on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes and topped with crispy thin onion rings. YUM!\n   - Chicken Parmesan - Nice and crispy.  Just your basic Chicken Parm!\n   - Chicken Tortelloni - Eh, not great.  Maybe it was the intense flavors of all the other foods that made this taste so bland, but It wasn't our favorite.\n   - Spaghetti & Meatballs - There is actually only one giant meatball.  That \""s\"" at the end is misleading!  Tasted good, not the best spaghetti I've had, but did its spaghetti duties.\n\n2 Desserts: \n   - Strawberry Pie (Special of the day) - I thought I had no room left, but I still scarfed this down.  Light and perfectly sweet.\n   - Apple Crostada - AMAZING.  So crispy and delicious.  Warm under a large scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Heavenly.\n\nI'm pretty sure I need to say some prayers and ask forgiveness for my gluttony.  I blame our server.  He kept sneaking more food on our table to \""give us our money's worth\"".  \n\nI think I need another nap."
"4","Good food - nice options for kids - good margaritas.  Clean restaurant... We will keep going back!"
"5","I have to make a confession: Usually, when I visit Las Vegas, I never think to leave the Strip.\n\nI know, I know -- Vegas locals despise people like me.  I'm talking about people who routinely fail to acknowledge that, surrounding the much-ballyhooed Strip, there's actually a large, diverse, and happening city  -- a city with countless hidden culinary treasures.\n\nBachi Burger is one of those treasures.  After Craig R. piqued my interest with his mouthwatering descriptions of Asian-inspired fusion burgers, I had to check it out.\n\nI dropped by here for lunch on a Saturday.  Bachi is located in a random strip mall on Windmill Lane (take the Blue Diamond Rd exit from the 15).  At ~11:30am, parking was a breeze and there were ample tables available.  I guess I should be thankful I missed the massive crowds that are known to congregate here.\n\nThe interior isn't much to look at (very minimalist and clean), but Bachi is all about the food.  I enjoyed the Ronin burger, which was cooked to a perfect medium.  It was topped with a decadent fried egg, crunchy cole slaw, and tangy BBQ sauce.  However, what really elevated this burger were the caramelized onions, whose depth of flavor was extraordinary.  The burger came with a small ramekin of yuzu aioli, which was also delectable -- I would've licked the damn thing clean if people weren't looking.\n\nOn the side, a had a bowl of their chili ginger edamame.  Let me say that this was the finest edamame that I've ever tasted.  Most edamame is overcooked into mush -- but not at Bachi.  Bachi's edamame is crunchy, fresh, and delicious.  The ginger was delightful, and the chili sauce provided a level of spice that was intense but not overpowering.\n\nService was fantastic.  My server, Kelly, moved quickly and efficiently -- always making sure that I was happily taken care of.  Even the prices are fair, since you're not dealing with the up-charges that are more typical of Strip restaurants.\n\nI can't wait to try Bachi's delicious delights again.  I'm drooling just thinking about it."
"2","I like garlic but garlic knots were so heavy on garlic that they were hot.   Owners and staff were fabulous but pizza was just average.   Most likely won't be going back."
"4","We ordered pizza delivery half Chicago and half Italiano, although it tooks in total 1 hour , they told us in advance so we were ready to wait. The delivery girl was friendly. The pizza was delicious, but a little pricey - its expensive when you add $5 delivery charge. Maybe next time we will pick up or go to the restaurant. I recommend it if you want a good pizza"
"3","I went here to have a manicure just before a wedding. I booked my appointment a week in advance and I'm glad I did. While they are happy to take walk ins, they were so busy they couldn't accommodate them while I was there. The staff is very friendly, especially the woman who answers the phones. Prices are very reasonable and the product is good. I have two minor complaints - the girl who did my nails was very aggressive with the cuticle trimmers, which is not intrinsically bad, but she nicked me pretty good and had to pause to put some liquid band aid on it to stop the bleeding. She was very apologetic. Second, she sprayed some kind of ethanol/isopropanol on my nails towards the end that dried my skin out which kind of negated all the moisturizer she applied earlier, and I left with my hands feeling dry. Other than that, it was a great experience. I do not live in the Vegas area but if I did I would absolutely return."
"4","What a great bar!  I have spent many an evening here drinking their inexpensive beer while watching drunk people dance.  This is not the \""pretty people\"" bar, this has the feel of a neighborhood bar.  Everyone is mostly friendly and I've never seen the place packed to the gills.  The decor is sorta old west, meets Hawaii.  Very strange.\n\nOn occasion they have cool theme parties (cool because of the FREE food) on the weekend.  I didn't see any happy hour specials the last time I was there but I didn't look.  There is easy access to the 101, but don't drive drunk, Snobsdale cops will catch you.\n\nThis place has a lot of regulars, but after a few visits you could fit right in."
"1","I went there with two of my co-workers and we all think it was a terrible meal. We each got the unlimited meat and seafood for $53.  I will never return to this place and I sure hope others do not waste their time and money. The quality of the meats were very low and they were always prepared as well done.  After complaining to our waiter he said they were suppose to ask us how we liked our meat prepared.  Once we asked them instead of them asking us, it was a little better.  However the meat was still not good.  Next time I'll spend my money somewhere else. \n\nIt's possible they were having a bad night.  Either way I'll never return."
"1","Scheduled an appointment for trimming weeks ahead of time due to how busy they are this time of year, booked for the 7th and was told this morning upon confirming that they had forgotten to book us - so they apologized and said that someone would be here between 1 and 2pm today. no one showed up or even called. I'm beyond done with this company. if you like to be forgotten and treated porly call first choice tree service - they're perfect for you"
"3","Went to try the drinks at happy hour. They were just OK. Too many to choose from. Somewhat gimmicky."
"4","Excellent drink selection and bar food that really takes it up a notch from what you'd normally expect. The beer-cheese pretzels, in addition to being beautifully presented, were a perfect compliment to my obscure hefeweizen from Germany. \n\nTheir imports also went well with my $3 mini-cheeseburgers; while each one was about as big as a half-dollar, they were clearly made from very high-quality beef and cheddar, and came with an exorbitant amount of deep-fried potato chips made from scratch. \n\nThe beet salad was honestly one of the best salads I've ever had.\n\nI do have one warning: don't even think about the bone marrow crostini if you aren't already a fan of bone marrow. Gamiest, smelliest piece of meat I've ever even looked at. I really should have known better than to order something as adventurous as that at what's basically a high-end pub. It reeked like urine and there was nothing on the plate to offset the squishy and smooth texture of the bone marrow other than their \""crostini\"" (toasted french bread). It at least could have used some spices."
"5","I heard of BK's Golf Service thur a resort I was staying at. It's also know as Las Vegas teetimes by BK's golf services. \nThey helped me with my golf arrangement. Jeff answered all my question and gave me reviews of some of the courses I was considering to play at.   I asked about Badlands GC and he told me what kind of game I had to play an a brief layout of the greens. Jeff saved me big  bucks. And for that I say \""Thank You Jeff and BK's.\""\nAlso, if you use these guys. Give them a phone number they can reach you at. They are good at following up on your golf plans if you have changes."
"4","I hardly ever go bowling... \nWe decided to go after a late business meeting and I am so glad we did! \nI forgot how fun it can be. \nThe space here seems to be recently remodeled, new and the bar is huge. \nThey have great specials during the week, making this a very affordable place to have some fun! \nThe bathrooms were clean, all the equipment worked perfectly. \nThere were leagues and families having a great time. \nThe beer was cold and the staff was friendly. \nWhat more could you ask for?? \n\nI just wish they could rig the system to give me a higher score...I am so much better on the Wii..."
"1","since i travel a lot to rodeo drive, ferrari isn't a mind blowing sight, and yes i'm one of those idiots who actually pay $10 just to see ferrari from outside.\n\nmy expectation was to see the interior of maserati and ferrari, turns out not. if its just exterior, i see it almost every day in my apartment's parking garage. mehhh"
"1","I had a piece of metal wire in my soup. The server brought us a new carafe of wine to make up for the error. However myself and one other guest were going to barely finish the first one we had ordered. One of us has a bit of a history with drinking, and occasionally rewards self for good behavior. Having a free bottle appear was not good for keeping that discipline. So instead of asking what he could do for us, he just took it upon himself to bring the wine. Unwanted, not touched, not cool.\n\nThrity minutes later, at the end of the meal I asked for the check and to speak to a manager so I could get his response to the object in the soup. I shouldn't have had to ask, he should have come to me. While waiting I called the customer service number for Outback and reported my experience. I had previously told the host and the server that I intended to pay my bill but I just wanted to talk to a manager, who arrived about one minute after I finished the call with Outback corporate headquarters. He took my debit card and check and disappeared for about ten minutes.\n\nWhen he returned he had a pleasant, glowing smile and handed me the check folder with the check and my debit card inside. I could see it had been zeroed out. Wow. All he had to do to get his head right was go back to his office, take a call from corporate, and realize he had better not take one penny from me. Do you think I'm stupid? If he himself wanted to comp the meal he didn't have to go through the charade of taking my debit card to the kitchen for ten minutes.\n\nHis expression and body language was so overly gracious when he showed me the zero check. As if he were doing me a great favor.\n\nI ended up getting some gift cards, so I decided to give them another try. At a later date I went in EARLY IN THE LUNCH HOUR just to get a visual inspection, since other previous visits had the place dirty. I went to the hostess stand and told her I found the bathroom filthy and all the child booster seats completely covered in food. I mean every single high chair and booster, and every one of them really bad.\n\nShe had a smug, disinterested expression since she knew I was just complaining and leaving. It went in one ear and out the other.\n\nA few nights later I called ahead and asked for a manager. I told him of all this, and told him that, against my better judgement, I was willing to give them one last try. I warned him that I would be especially looking at the cleanliness of the bathroom and what I had previously seen at the booster seats, and that I'm coming in with children.\n\nI arrived a while later, took my son to the restroom. One urinal was completely covered in urine, there were wet paper towels and toilet paper on the floor and the. On my way out I noticed on particular triangle shaped piece of paper towel on the floor between the two bathrooms. The kid seats were not as bad as the previous visit, but not great. Granted they would likely be wiped down before being given to a family but they shouldn't be sitting there dirty.\n\nAn hour and a half later, I returned to the bathroom and found it in EXACTLY the same untouched state. That little triangle of paper was moved slightly from people walking around but it was right there.\n\nI brought my concerns to the kitchen manager. I told her of my concerns that any establishment that takes hygiene shortcuts where the customers can see could potentially be taking worse shortcuts behind closed doors. She assured me that her standard at her primary job as kitchen manager is extremely high and sometimes gets grumbling from her employees that she's too harsh, picky and particular. That's a good thing. Well her high standards didn't prevent us from getting a stack of wet, oily bread plates.\n\nHey restaurant managers, do you really think your rushed servers are going to actually take accountability and inspect what they bring to the table? They just trust that the dishwashers did their job.\n\nIt was like an intentional slap in the face when I had called the dining room manager and said, \""Hey, red alert! On my way! I didn't like your dirty bathrooms and kid seats! I have gift cards from a previous bad experience! I'll be checking out the bathrooms!\"" and then, to find, among all things, that the bathroom was horrible when I got there and untouched for the next 90 minutes.\n\nAnd the hygiene nazi in the kitchen is putting out dirty plates.\n\nThey asked me to give them time to turn things around. Here's an idea: supervise and hold people accountable. Surprise inspections. Show up on your off time and see if your employees are bullshitting you"
"3","It's your typical Best Buy store.  They just underwent a remodel not too long ago, so it's organized a bit better and isn't as crammed as it used to be in here.  The staff is...well they're your average Best Buy staff.  They know a little bit about the stock in their section, but they tend to be in no way experts.\n\nI was just in here yesterday which reminded me of one of the worst parts of this location.  I don't know WTF it is, but as soon as you walk into the doors here it always smells like a mixture of mildew and cat piss in the entrance!  That is both annoying and very offensive to my nostrils.  I've mentioned it to the guy that stands by the door before, and he understood my pain...that poor guy has to deal with it on a daily basis.  I recommend a manager pulling a steam cleaner off the shelf, dump a bottle of febreeze into its water reservoir, and get to work!!!"
"3","If there customer service didn't suck they would have gotten 5 stars. I come to phoenix a few times a year to shop, enjoy the cactus and spend time decorating my vacation condo. Last Thursday morning I found myself craving coffee but lacking fresh water. The water here is brown and completely undrinkable. I could see the word coffee  taunting me from my balcony, so I did the very un AZ thing and walked here. The place is super cute. Plenty of seating and it had a good atmosphere. It took 5 minutes for the girl to ask me what I wanted. I was the only one standing at the register and they had like 4 employees standing around talking. Forgive me for wanting formalities. What do you want? doesn't put me in a good mood. My cafe au lait was far better then you should be able to get in Phoenix. The foam was creamy and had a pretty design on top. The next time I am in town I will definitely be back but only because your coffee is good and you are 300 hundred feet from my vacation condo. Just don't expect a tip."
"4","This place is definitely about the noodles, and they are definitely first class.  The dumplings are also excellent.  \n\nWhat everyone should realize is Everyday Noodles is Taiwanese cuisine, so although it may not meet your expectations, if you are open to discovering what they have to offer on their own terms, you will be pleasantly surprised.\n\nMy waiter was extremely helpful in guiding me through the menu and suggesting dishes that would appeal to me.\n\nThe portions are generous, and the noodles are comfort food heaven.\n\nI love the decor, it's rather sophisticated and well designed.  This place is a great find.\n\nI'm ending with a tip.  Try the Sweet Egg Yolk Steamed Bun.  It comes with 3 steamed buns, so very appropriate for sharing, and oh so delicious!"
"4","This place is pretty good. I have no complaints, but it's nothing too special. Okay... I'm a vegetarian, so I can't comment on the burgers. But the service has always been quick and friendly here from the servers and bartenders. The shakes are good, but I usually order one of the well-priced craft beers (they have a great selection) or a deconstructed cocktail.\n\nMy favourite is probably the deconstructed tequila cocktail - a shot of tequila with a chaser of sangrita (yes!!!) followed with a can of tecate for $7. My boyfriend got the pickle back - a shot of whiskey with a pickle juice chaser followed by a PBR for $6. Nice! I think these are really fun.\n\nThe crack dip is good, but the truffle cheese wiz is even way better. That's the dip that brings me back for serious bar snacks. Yum!"
"2","This is only my second Cirque show (I saw Iris twice tho). Like many others, I felt the clowns were too much filler, and I found them to be extremely annoying. Not as many acrobatics, no contortionists, etc. Iris was better."
"2","+ not busy\n+ nice ambiance\n+ good wait service\n\n- can't beat grand luxe's selection\n- food is meh even when intoxicated\n- food comes out slowly"
"4","Huge sandwich, loved it!"
"5","Hubby and I were back at Pappadeaux last Monday. Right off the bat I will say that I have never gone to Pappadeaux and not had at least a 15 minute wait. There have been times that I was quoted a 1.5 hour wait. Waiting sucks but the food is worth it. Personally a 45 minute wait is my cut off but if there is a seat at the bar I will get a few drinks while waiting. \n\nWe were seated and the waitress explained that she was training so we expected to possibly experience a couple hiccups. We ordered a dozen oysters, fried gator and shared a blackened salmon and salad. Our oysters and gator came out immediately with bread and butter. Everything was excellent. Then we waited for our entree and salad....and waited...and waited. After about 15 to 20 minutes our waitress came by and apologized and let us know that our entree was coming. I tried to play it cool and not act agitated but at this point we knew we would miss the movie that we had planned on seeing after eating. I requested that she bring out our salad while we wait for our entree. \n\nOur waitress arrived 5 minutes later with our entree and salad in hand and once again apologized for the wait. She also explained that our there was an issue with our salmon when the chef split our meal onto two plates and that she would be bringing us out another fillet shortly. BTW, it is nice that it was split for 2 but I would have been equally happy to share from the same plate, however I do see this as an over and above service and appreciate these little efforts. She also offered to bring us a dessert at the end of our meal to make up for the wait and the problem with the salmon. The food was all delicious and as promised the waitress brought out the dessert tray and asked what we would like to try. We went for the creme brulee which did not disappoint. Our check did not include the dessert and we were given half off our oysters. This is why I adore Pappadeaux. If there is a problem they go way beyond to fix it and make it up to you."
"3","The food at Chipotle is amazing of course!\n\nBut... There is always a line at this location because of how slow they make the food. They do skimp on the portions and seeing other people complain about it on here just reaffirms my suspicions. \n\nThe workers have been courteous in my experiences... they just don't give a lot of meat.\n\nALSO, the online ordering really slows the process down. I waited a long time while online orders were being made. Get rid of this online ordering, Chipotle. This is ruining your customer service."
"5","The BEST fried shrimp I have had in over a decade! Great food, friendly staff, and no microwave!  Wife and I went here for the first time, we had the Coconut shrimp, and the lightly breaded shrimp. We've been to restaurants that charged 4 times the price, and the quality was less than half. Shrimp tasted great! Crispy, and not covered in a ton of batter. The employees were helpful, and very friendly. Cant wait to go back!"
"3","After you win Megabucks, then come here.  Otherwise you won't be able to afford anything in this mall.  Still a nice place aesthetically to do some window shopping.  Layout is cool and worthy of picture taking, but after you study it for a while, not a good layout to walk around easily.  This place is in between Aria, Cosmopolitan and Planet Hollywood, so it makes a good hub between the casinos.  It also is a tram stop between Bellagio and Monte Carlo.  It's a nice place and if you're near it, you should stop by.  My flagship casino malls are still Caesar and Venetian, so because of that I can't put this on the top of my list, but nonetheless something that you should give a try."
"3","My husband is the obsessive Pho fan so I am constantly subjected to the pleas of Vietnamese take-out. We came here the other day for lunch and there were things I liked and didn't. We ordered the fried spring rolls ($2.50, I think) that were pretty damn good. For lunch I ordered the BBQ pork bahn-mi (sp?) that was $2.25. The bread was just the way I like it, soft on the inside, flaky on the outside. It was stuffed with BBQ pork, cucumber, cilantro, carrots and some other veggies. I snagged some of the leftover sprouts from my husband's Pho and put it in my sandwich. Very good. My beefs? Half of the meat in my sandwich was all fat. I am one of those people that virtually loses my appetite if I chew on something that has fat hanging off the side. My husband, who loves the fat, was shocked at how much of the \""meat\"" in my sandwich I was giving him. I had plenty to eat of what was fast becoming a veggie sandwich but still, that was pretty annoying. The last thing I want to do is be picking my food apart in a restaurant. My second beef was that not once did they come back to refill our water. That was a problem since our food was a little spicy. That isn't to say I wouldn't go back. Our bill was $10 for lunch....seriously Pho Thahn? That is damn reasonable and the food is decent enough for me to go back....for take-out."
"1","Just like the classic Miley Cyrus song, this place gets stuck in your brain for all the wrong reasons. \n\nI came here because I literally needed 15 balloons blown-up for an event. I was helped after I stood at the counter for a bit and waited for the girl behind it to finish her text. I told her my situation and she obliged by taking my balloons, setting them off to the side, and getting another worker to both ring me out and inflate the balloons. Apparently the cellphone rules all things around her.\n\nWhile \""balloon girl\"" inflated my balloons, another customer walked up and needed to be rang out. The \""cellphone girl\"" didn't move a muscle and asked \""balloon girl\"" to stop and help them out... really?\n\nWhen I asked \""cellphone girl\"" if she could continue with my order, I was told she couldn't because at the moment she needed to get a package ready to ship before the post office closes. Umm...  It's 4:50pm, so unless you're the Flash, you will never make it to the post office. Ouch my brain. \n\nParty USA might have the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Never-mind the clueless worker who probably puts in 15 hours a week after high school, the I guess \""manager\"" who is loudly placing a food order via her cellphone while walking through the store, but what really bothered me is the girl behind the counter. Can't you at least pretend like you give a shit about anything besides text messages or the latest update on Justin Bieber's FB page? \n\nPlus this location is extremely dirty. Boxes and trash all over the place. Definitely a tripping hazard nightmare. \n\nSorry. I went a little George Carlin on this review, but I mean... Ugh. Seriously, avoid this place like the walls are releasing Ebola fumes."
"2","Mediocre food that's slow to arrive.\n\nTook my teen in for her 18th birthday. Despite the fact that there was only one other table seated, the service was incredibly slow. When the food finally arrived, only the lasagna was hot (molten, even). Everything else was room temperature. Apparently they cooked all of the other plates *then* baked the lasagna for about 15 minutes while the rest of the order sat out getting cold. \n\nEven if the food had been served hot I don't think it would have been anything to rave about. The chicken marsala was thin and dry inside. The sauce was cold and congealing. The vegetables looked like they were fresh about a week before. Bread was hard and bland. \n\nAtmosphere: Strip mall storefront trying to be Streets of New York. \n\nTo top it off, the waiter - who only had 1 other table - forgot to bring out the complimentary b-day dessert the hostess offered, despite his being told twice that it was her b-day (once by us and once by the hostess). \n\nIt wasn't the worst restaurant I've been to but in these tight times, I won't be recommending it to anyone. Me and mine won't be going back either. Too many other places with better food and service out there."
"5","Friend of mine and I ate at STK last Sunday in LV.  Other friends we were traveling with opted to catch a Beatles show elsewhere in town, and after hearing their \""review\"" of that show, I know my friend and I had the better evening.\n\nTwo guys at a steakhouse for dinner, so it stays pretty basic:  drinks, salads, steaks and a few sides.  It was ALL GOOD at this place.  I'll admit to having some reservations based on prior reviews regarding the noise level in the restaurant, and am very pleased to say we didn't experience that at all.  Maybe those running STK have read the reviews and toned it down?  Granted it was a Sunday night, but it didn't seem like either the Cosmopolitan hotel or STK restaurant was particularly jumpin' that night.  We got a table right away, and were able to carry on a normal conversation throughout the dinner.\n\nI started with the wedge salad while my friend had some kind of bibb lettuce roll-up special, and they were both good.  A pleasing amount of bleu cheese in my wedge, which I think is the perfect setup for our steak entrees that followed.  I had a large NY Strip steak, cooked perfectly medium rare, which my friend opted for short ribs, which he said were fantastic.  Our two sides were also terrific, a dish of sauteed spinach and another side of fingerling potatoes roasted in garlic.  I know the potatoes were all gone before we left the table, while there was some spinach left, but think that was more because our appetites were satisfied than anything else.\n\nCouple of dirty martini's with bleu cheese stuffed olives over the course of the evening, and we were quite happy.  My friend picked up the tab so I didn't see the final tally, but I'd estimate easily $100 - $150 each, as I think everything was ala carte.  But I'd go to this place again in a heartbeat, next time in Vegas."
"2","GREAT: 14 beers on tap!\nNOT GREAT: beer served warm. \nWhen a reviewer goes on and on for paragraphs about the kind of \""fusion\"" represented, that's a relatives or associates review you can bet. \nPointed info is the heart of YE_P!"
"4","Will have to definitely check this place out again when in Vegas...that is all :)"
"4","This place is awesome for all your Mexican food needs. The store carries limited selection so if your looking for something that you can find at your local grocery store it might not be here. \nI recently made a batch of strawberry tamales and found everything I needed except for the strawberries. Hehe.  As I was very limited on time it was awesome that I found remade unseasoned masa por tamales.  This place has great prices for all their products. I love getting their preseasoned carne asada and tres leches for dessert."
"4","Dotty Dumpling's Dowry supposedly has the best burger in Madison. I say it depends on what kind of burger you're in the mood for. The burger at Dotty's is maybe a half an inch thick, and drips with grease. I've had the bread completely fall apart under the weight of the patty. They're always cooked exactly right, but I suggest you get it a little more charred than normal if you don't want to get sick. It's just too much if your stomach isn't properly trained for it.\n\nNow if you're looking for something that is thick and juicy, it is a pretty excellent burger. They have all sorts of varieties and special sauces that you can throw on the burger as well, though the standard cheese-lettuce-tomato-onion combination is probably the best one. There's also a great beer selection to compliment it; the bar in here is way underrated.\n\nOne time, for a change of pace, I tried the jerk chicken sandwich. Terrible idea, it was completely dry and tasteless. Stick to ordering what Dotty's is good at - big burgers and fried comfort food."
"4","Why would they allow a Dog in the Cathouse? .No really....Dog The Bounty hunter was hanging out with Carrot Top last night.  I wonder if they had a hair contest who would win for most bizzare?  \n\nWe came here after a brief visit to LAX.  It was about midnight and the restaurant portion was closed and they were converting the area to the nightclub.  They let us stay during the conversion but just us, a Dog, a Carrot and their entourage.\n\nSo we got to keep our booth which was nice because after 1 the place was packed with people.  I think a lot of them were hookers because not only did they look it but they would go up to random men and get nasty with them (see photos).  Oh yeah...the sexy girl in the red is one of the dancers."
"5","Japan Creek is the perfect Japanese market. While they obviously can't carry everything, what they do carry is very valuable and more important than the other things. The prices ar reasonable when you understand it's a specialty shop in a good location, but if you are expecting Walmart pricing you'll be disappointed. Though if you're expecting Walmart, you probably can't appreciate a tiny Japanese market anyway... but it's never too late to branch out.\n\nThey also offer bento boxes and riceballs of various flavors (tuna mayo, go get it), and they're good! They bring in baked goods from Mammoth Bakery in LA, so there is even a hookup for Japanese pastries (curry-pan!).\n\nIt has truly made our experience living in the area better. We were worried moving to Las Vegas because of a small-ish Japanese population, but having Japan Creek near by has made us feel very comfortable.\n\nThe staff is always friendly and happy, but you may want to brush up on Japanese lessons before trying to chat."
"2","The only good things about this hotel-casino are that it is cheap and it has a great location on the Strip.  The rooms were quaint (meaning really old).  Although I requested a non-smoking room, they gave me a room that reeked of cigarettes.  I asked for another room and they shoe-horned me into a tiny shoebox of a room next to the emergency exit.  It really felt like the room doubled as an interrogation cell.  I asked for another room and they finally gave me a room that didn't smell like an ashtray and I could turn around without slamming into something.  I know they have renovated \""deluxe\"" rooms but I have the sneaking suspicion that there's one model room on the top floor reserved for the few VIP's willing to venture to Harrah's.  The truly sad thing is that I'll probably go back there because it really is cheap...haha."
"2","I'm going to reiterate what other reviewers have said previously. The service is completely lacking here. The servers - while friendly - take an exorbitant amount of time to come to your table. The kitchen - while making incredibly tasty food - is unacceptably slow. And the price you pay for both is just far too much for what you get. \n\nAs for kid/family friendly, I would try somewhere else or get carry out. This place is a brewpub that tries to be good for families, but in the end it's still just a bar.\n\nTasty food but not enough to make up for the other detractors."
"5","Our new favorite spot!!!!! Been here a few times have ordered different things (my boyfriend and I) and have all exceeded our expectations :) Service is great and speedy. Love love love this place!"
"1","I should have known better than to expect a 5-star hotel for a 1-star price. I looked at the pictures online and it never mentioned that the entire hotel and streets surrounding it were under major construction. The parking ramp was hard to find and the check-in desk seemed like it was a mile away from the parking ramp entrance. Our room was clean enough and housekeeping was quick to bring up the extra towels I requested. \n\nHowever, the tub was terrible. It took about 15-20 minutes to drain after I was done with my shower, which meant I had to re-wash my feet and legs. Nasty. \n\nAlso, the walkway to the Strip is under construction and that entire area smelled like urine. Really gross!\n\nI'd definitely spend a little more next time and avoid the slow-draining tub and urine scented walkway."
"1","Service sucks. Book couple room suppose to b all the same but it's not. One room was 3 and a half larger than out other room. Customer service was no help. This place is gonna lose costumes."
"2","We've been to several cajun places in La. & this place is far from them. For people that are from there, we expected much more. The entry was very bright & unappealing but were greeted by friendly helpful people.Atmosphere really cheezy. No alchahol a minus.I had crawfish etouffey(? on spellin) witch was very good.Red beans& rice was less than good . Very dry& tasted like canned brown beans. Wife had chicken& sausage gumbo witch was good. Two customers had returned there food & left unsatisfied while we were there. I like a good po-boy so I'll goback & try that ,but my wife won't go back. All&all pretty crappy dining exp.Sorry, but that's just us."
"3","Garlic chicken is way too sweet for my taste. Hong Kong style noodles was slot better than the chicken. Price is right.\n\nWent back a two weeks later for lunch specials and was not disappointed. Lunch specials are awesome. NOthing more than $6.  I had the General Tso's chicken. Right amount of spice with red chili peppers and slices of jalapeno.  Lots of chicken and noodles on the side were really tasty.  My wife had the shrimp with snow peas,  Lots of snow peas and the shrimp were plentiful and succulent.  Fried rice was non-descript."
"2","This is a mixed review. Only because i did like their 3 cheese mac and cheese and their creamed corn.  But my brisket tasted horrible,  took 2 bites too many. It tasted like they had squirted way too much fluid to light up their pit and the flavor impregnated into the brisket,  their baby back ribs were OK, Chili's Ribs are way better...  My husband was so excited to have some bbq, but was very disappointed. \nthe host was a bit rude, and the waitress ignored us more than a few times when trying to get her attention after our 7 yr old spilled all his lemonade on the table. \n\nI would go back to have their sides and drinks, NEVER their brisket...."
"2","This review for the one at Gate C5:\n\nThankful they open at 5am... gotta have my caffeine for these early morning trips, but this one seems to short my cup no matter what size.  What's that all about?"
"2","I've been to this La Parrila Suiza a couple of times now. I keep getting invited by some friends to join them in this Mexico City food fest.  They love this place so I've hesitant in writing this review but after our last meal I feel I must \""spill the beans\""...\n\nService ~ They are really friendly and helpful when ordering but they are very slow. I mean, come on!  You can only play \""eye spy\"" so many times before you loose interest in why your there to begin with.  The only... and I mean only reason we did not leave was due to their tri-salsa dippage action with crispy chips.  It is really one salsa a pico de gallo and a green creamy kinda of dip\n\nFood ~ Chicken flautas were ok, three of them fried, topped with sour cream and Piquillo sauce served with rice, guacamole cole slaw and beans. The cole slaw and beans were not goo at all.  \n\nWe also had the Chicken Melt which was very good but we were shorted one of the tortillas!  It was supposed to be two flour tortillas filled with melted cheese, chicken bacon, avocado and tomatoes, topped with cheese and a sauce. It also came with their beans rice and cole slaw.  It took so long to get our order we didn't bother saying anything...\n\nOur last order was a chicken taco salad.  It was HUGE and served in a very crisp tortillas bowl.  The salad was tossed with all of the ingredients which was different.  I enjoy separating some of the chicken, cheese and other goodies in the salad bowl, but with this salad you could not do that ~ it was all tossed together.  The chicken was very cold and tasted blah. The bland dressing was also tossed into the salad which made this thing a big bowl of mushy lettuce, yuk-a-roo.\n\nSo if your meeting a friend and they are buying this might be a good place for you to go."
"1","The chicken was dry & very salty. The waffles were fairly bland. The service was lousy too. If you love salty, sugary, high saturated fat items you may enjoy this restaurant. I'd prefer to clogg my arteries else where, thank you!"
"3","I can see why people like this place (big portions, chips!), but I didn't find the food memorable.  It could be it's one of the few eating places in Wickenburg open past 8 p.m.  It's difficult to find unique Mexican food in the Southwest.  And you're not going to fin unique Mexican food in Wickenburg."
"4","5 girls, 7:30pm on a Saturday night with 13 people ahead of us in line = 1 hour wait. Seated in the middle for a perfect view! The chef was hilarious and makes small talk with everyone (keep in mind this is really a BAR in the middle of the hotel, not a restaurant. Seats only about 15).\n\nWas it worth it? YES! We had our 99cents margaritas from Palace Station in hand while waiting in line. (The best and worst idea). Margaritas filled us up a little. Our group of 5 girls shared 3 combo pan roasts (shrimp, LOBSTER, crab). We finished total a little over 1 bowl .. woops. To-go'd the rest of them. There is a $5 charge to share bowls. The pan roast was so creamy and delicious - my favorite part: CHUNKS OF LOBSTER. Ohhhh yeah =) You can only eat so much at a time though since its so thick and creamy so you'll always end up wanting more .. beware!\n\nOur bill came out to be about $100 w/ tax and tip."
"2","Been a while since I've ate a burrito. A very unusual adjustment considering that I lived on Mexican food back in LA. But since I'm in Vegas for school, I don't know much about the local joints for tasty food but this came to my attention and it had its share of good reviews, but also disappointing ones. I'm stuck in the middle but I would consider myself slightly disappointed rather. I got the chorizo super burrito for somewhere around six bucks. Not too sure of what the exact price was. But anyway, the burrito was good for a first try. But I don't see myself coming back. There was no condiments and the complimentary hot sauce was no bueno. There was also a bit too much salt in the burrito. If that's what makes up for their taste in a burrito, I'd rather head to taco bell. Save your money and drive down 2 miles south to Fausto's."
"1","Horrible!! Came here on suggestion from my bf's sister. The waitress spilled a drink on a member of our party. That was the first bad thing. Service was lacking. Wrong size juice was brought. Water never came. My bf and I ordered the tuscan chicken sandwich and halfway through the chicken was undercooked. Gross. We came in during a busy time so i think they rushed the food. They comped these two dishes, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I will never return."
"2","Like another reviewer said, it does look like more from the outside.  When I walked in, it was actually a pretty shabby stand near the antique mall.  Prices weren't bad I guess, but the burgers were very blah as well as the fries.  Definitely are much much better places to get a good burger than here.  I'll give it one thing, it was all very fresh, as they didn't make it till we ordered it.  Maybe a decent eat if you happen to be shopping at the antique mall, but don't think we'll be coming back just for the food!"
"5","You know you sometimes get a gut instinct when a place is going to be good? I got that vibe about The Clock, and I was certainly not disappointed.\n\nIn an area with cheap eating options scattered all around, it can hard to settle on one of the many cafes. But something about The Clock stuck out from the other contenders vying for my hungry attention. \n\nPerhaps it's the neo Victorian fronting, complete with pillar box red paint. Or maybe the clock decorating on the exterior struck me as being different from the remaining cheap or samey options. But whatever it was that lured me in, I'm very glad.\n\nThe Clock is somewhat new to the scene but I can see it being really successful. For a start, it's chilled out, nicely decorated with neutral art and cream coloured walls, and is spacious if you're in with a larger group. It may appear smaller on the outside but they have a secret spiral staircase taking you to a much more open dining area downstairs. If you can't get to this area, there's enough space upstairs for wheelchair or buggy access.\n\nSecondly, along with a vast array of delicious, well prepared food, they also have a bottled beer and wine selection! This added bonus, along with the healthy portions you receive with main meals and even with lucnhtime snacks opens it out towards evening diners.\n\nThe staff seemed to genuinely care about the customers and were certainly passionate about cooking. This showed in the standard of my panini (which was also generously served up with chips and crispy salad). I opted for the Turkish sausage and it was outstanding. For a lunchtime snack it was way above par - definitely of a higher standard. I also received the best hot chocolate I've ever tasted, it was perfect. The girl's skills put me to shame since I would definitely 3 star my efforts half the time. But this one was a work of art! And all of that for a fiver!\n\nIt's very rare that you find a cafe with such incredible choice. But what really stands out is the pride the staff take in their work. They went out of their way to look after their customers, and the cooking was to die for. \n\nWatch as word of mouth spreads about The Clock - in time, this will become one of Edinburgh's dining highlights."
"1","Horrible! Most of the employees, including some who were apparently off duty, were too busy hanging around chatting with each other to get orders packed correctly, interact with customers in a friendly manner, or clean the disgusting bathrooms and customer seating area.\n\nEdited to add this follow-up: Complained to KFC about the lousy service, wrong food, and disgusting, dirty conditions. Got a standard apology letter with a $5 certificate usable only at the location we told them we'd never go to again. Way to go KFC! Way to listen to your customers. Not that they have to since they're so big, but it makes me question myself every time I get a thought about visiting any of their stores, and I've stopped myself from going there from time to time."
"3","A crispy chicken sandwich with cheese is 7.29 and tasted similar to McDonalds'.  It took 30 minutes to get at the drive through.  Not a bad burger by any means but way overpriced for what it is."
"5","I have been to this place twice with my coworkers. They have a really good lunch menu for $9.99 plus tax. You can order an appetizer and an entree or an entree and desert. \n\nI really enjoyed this place and want to try there happy hour one of these days."
"3","The reviews for this place seem to be all over the board and it is near me so I decided to try it.  I ordered a chopped (pork, beef, ham) sandwich ($7.95) and a root beer ($1.79).  With that I had a choice of one of several sides which if purchased separately would be in the $1.95-2.95 range. I chose the garden salad.   I was interested in the Mac and cheese even though at $3.95 it was not one of my options, I started to order is as a side and my waitress warned me it was like Kraft.  It appears they have 2 mac and cheese offerings, the cheap stuff they use for sides and kids meals and the 4 cheese baked stuff you can only get as a main entree.  At $3.95 for a side I would have  expected the good stuff so I am glad I was led away from it.\n\nThe service wasn't exceptionally slow but the pace is certainly not quick.  The whole place lacks a certain enthusiasm.  The sandwich was OK, the salad was OK, the restaurant looked OK, the restrooms were OK.  I thought the booths/tables were small, and I noticed they were seating one person at two tops and 2 people at 4 tops and 4 people at 6 tops so I must not be the only one who thought that.  My interpretation of the decor is they were trying to hard.\n\nThis is another one of those places I wouldn't refuse to go to but if I was in the area I most likely would prefer to try something new and different."
"1","Accents of the English which sound so classy to Americans do NOT make up for their COMPLETE disregard for the disabled.I made every attempt well in advance to get special seating for my son and for which I was happy to pay more and NOTHING was done!When I called customer service today the US rep could have cared less, did not apologize and offered NO help. It was basically TFB!  My son will sufer fir more than 10 hours tomorrow on a flight from London Phoenix and I can not help and BA NEVER had an interest in helping. I will let EVERY disability group in this country and UK know about BA insensitivity so that they can seek other airlines. PS They have a web page with disabled assistance but no specific contacts for those disabled.In other words, just bull but no action for those with disability. If you are disabled choose an airline other than BA whenever you can."
"5","My friends and I were looking for a place to get manicures and pedicures while in Vegas. After seeing the outrageous prices on the strip for basic mani/pedis I decided to look elsewhere.\n\nI turned to Yelp and once again, Yelp did not disappoint. There were four of us so I made sure to make an appointment which worked out great.\n\nThis is by far the best pedicure and manicure I've ever had anywhere! This place is awesome, detailed, thorough, and they take their time. \n\nWe all felt so relaxed after our visit to this place and will definitely be coming back on our next trip.\n\nWhether you live here or are visiting you need to come visit this place. You're not going to get great service with great prices anywhere else in Las Vegas."
"1","Too much thick, sugary frosting on some of the cupcakes. Some of the cakes can be dry. Plus the owner never realized charges were not going through on his payment system, then realized the error 8 months later and posted all the old charges- 7 of them to my account in one day! I thought I had identity theft w/ 7 charges in 1 day! My debt card, pin and online bank passwords had to be changed prior to finding out the real problem after talking with the owner. By then I was very inconvenience, spent a lot of time dealing w/ the bank and now no debt card for 7-10 days. Will not be going back! What kind of quality controls do you have if you don't know your POS system is not processing cards correctly! This issue did not just effect me."
"4","I thought it was time to write about the amazing facial I had at Life Spa with Bethany. \n\nMy skin felt great from all the wonderful products, my shoulders and scalp felt great from the awesome massage, and my wallet felt great from using my new member ticket!\n\nEveryone was very kind and professional -- from the girl that greeted me to Bethany to the girl at the front desk who asked me how everything went. \n\nTwo things I thought were really great:\n1) Life Spa doesn't use bottled water. They instead offer you filtered water in a real glass. I dislike those mini bottled waters and I think they taste worst than filtered water. \n\n2) My scalp massage. My brain felt like it was on vacation for the entire facial. So relaxing and so wonderful."
"4","Been there for lunch on a few weekends. A nice place for some bar food in a casual atmosphere.\n\nUsually get the burger or chicken sandwich. The bun is great (a little different than the usual) and the sandwiches are always solid. They are not skimpy on the fries - which I like. Service is usually first rate.\n\nSometimes the TV sound is a bit overwhelming inside. Parking can be difficult, but there are nearby lots hidden behind some of the other places on 7th St. \n\nIf you see a Groupon for the place. Buy it and try it."
"1","I've tried this place twice.  The first time I ate here, I ordered the \""Bench Warrant\"" rice bowl.  Not totally disgusting and it got a few bites out of me.  Not impressed.  The second time I ordered an egg sandwich.  Who messes up an egg sandwich??  The Verdict's Inn does that's who!!!  Not only did they get my order wrong, the egg was disgusting, they used shredded cheese, and topped it with way too much spinach and lettuce.  I asked for no pico and guess what, my sandwich was drenched with it.  I'll NEVER eat here again!"
"2","Expensive veal scallopini tasted like it was from the OLIVE GARDEN. The service was a little slow. Overpriced.   They need a menu do over"
"1","I always give 1-star to Hotels that accept anonymous Priceline bids and then charge extra \""resort fees\"" when you show up.\n\nThat's fine if you want to hide fees from window shoppers to make your sticker price look lower than it really is.  Let them dig through your fine print and decide to stay elsewhere if they so choose.\n\nBut to accept anonymous bids from services such as Priceline where customers have zero visibility into your extra fees until their credit card has already been charged is unethical ( and you know it ).  I suspect that the law hasn't caught up to this new modern flavor of bait and switch that you folks in the Hotel business are experimenting with.  Enjoy ripping people off while the party lasts."
"4","What a charming place with wonderful staff.\n\nI came here with my Sis and her kids during my visit on Memorial Day Weekend.  Thankful that I had the whole brood with me as  I was able to take a bite out of everyone's pie. \n\nOrdered:\nScotch Eggs - tasty, however I would've preferred the yolk to be more on the medium side\nLovely Bit a Salmon - refreshing, the lighter choice from all the other pies \nBangers and Mash - can't go wrong with this sausage and mashed potato\nShepherds Pie - another classic treat in a pie\nThe Oggie - perfect with a great wine aroma\nSticky Toffee Pudding - comes to you hot a la mode or with creme anglais (or both), we opted for just the creme anglais. \n\nLondon Mule - a wonderful accompanied to wash down the pie\n\nAll the crusts were perfect and this pie lover is in heaven.\n\nThe atmosphere was warm and friendly. The staff attentive.  This is truly a gem in downtown Scottsdale. \n\nThanks Yelp for leading me to this great establishment. I'll definitely be back."
"5","Great service (cute Hispanic girl) always kept my husband and my coffee filled, great food, awesome menu!!! red velvet pancakes are the biz!!!!!!! My new favorite spot!!!!!!!"
"1","I made an appointment, showed up 6min late and there was only 2 ladies working only one customer there. The man at the front desk was very nice but the nail ladies where stuck up and rude when the male at the desk asked if they could still take my appointment. They shook their heads no turned me away!!! I've never felt so embarrassed in my entire life. They lost a good customer because I will never go again. I drove 45 min out there just to get my nails done but wasted my time and gas just to get denied. Sucks for them I usually spend $50 on my nails. Worst nail experience ever!!"
"1","If I could give less I would... One of the dirtiest kitchens I have ever seen.. food greasy not house made.. the owner should be ashamed with his suposedly culinary background.. unlsess you want to get sick.. never ever eat there... I have seen behind the scenes and its alarming."
"4","great chai   !!!  this place has alot of room to move around and enjoy your coffee and wifi..."
"5","Fantastic!  I'm a displaced NY Italian and was dismayed until I found the Queen Creek Olive Mill.  I honestly didn't expect to find decent olive products here in AZ.  I was very impressed with the product quality.  The selection is pretty diverse too.  I tried some of the food at the bistro counter and was also impressed by the quality and presentation.  Very tasty.  The staff is knowledgeable and helpful."
"1","incompetent basterds when i order pizza hear @1:40 pm and @ 4:30 pm the came hear and the pizza was ice cold i told the maneger and he said  all he can do is sand a card in mail next month the people who work there disapoint me so much im not ordering from this papa johns again do not order from this place or you'll be dissapointed fuck this place"
"1","$9.50 plus tax just to put a 3 X 6 box into another box to protect original packaging. Highway robbery plus the cost of shipping. Owner claims people pay over $10 for box packaging materials labor. Also needed an RMA printed and they charge $2.50 to RECEIVE an email plus $1 to print one page. Mind you they originally gave me the wrong email to forward to and had me waiting for that store to fax my email to the store I was wanting the email address for. What a joke to tell you $10 for a small box with a straight face plus the cost of shipping."
"5","We experienced a well planned menu and courteous wait staff.  Timely service with incredible food set a perfect evening.  The peach margarita was refreshing.  The chicken skewers were delicious.  The courses complimented each other and added to the evening.  The fact we were able to support Restaurant Week added to the perfect evening.  We would highly recommend this restaurant."
"4","Total hole in the wall, SIGN ME UP!!!  We ate at Yen with my dad and sister and the food was great. The boys has Udon noodles, and the rest of us had sushi.  My favorite was the Philly roll with asparagus.  My favorite roll ever has asparagus, so this was a huge suprise and a total treat! \n\nYen is completely unassuming from the outside, and you would easily drive past it.  It is totally worth stopping into say hi and have some excellent food, both sushi and Japanese."
"5","Everyone here is always sweet.  The brownies are plentiful and super-chocolatey and the cookies are delicious.  I'm told they have great bread, though I've yet to try it.  There are a few tables to sit at if you want to stick around.\n\nHighly recommend this place if you're looking for a good treat."
"1","No happy hour on pick ups, means 14$ for a tiny roll cut by Michael J Fox. and two delicious pieces of yellow tail. The server didn't have change, and they put the fried roll in with the nigiri so they were very sweaty, and warm."
"3","Its been quite a while since I have been back here.  We were kind of on a strike from going to four peaks but I really wanted to try the arizona chicken rolls which tasted like chicken salad (not grilled like it says its supposed to be) rolled in a puff pastry and the sweet jalapeno sauce is the reason i wanted to try it so bad because i love that stuff on the southwestern burger.  I have never hated anything before at four peaks and last night my boyfriend actually said it. \""I Hate this, i do not like this at all; it tastes  like chicken from a can\"" Thats what it tasted like. I was expecting some grilled chicken and in chunks not a salad mayoish filling. Severely dissapointed twice now. It seems like service and food are starting to diminish before our eyes.\n\nSO SAD :("
"2","The guy Doug who works here and is a management trainee is a complete jerk. I came in to rent a car because my car was in the shop for repairs from a car accident. I literally just stood there for a half an hour while he fumbled his way through my insurance claim information (which I told to him at least three times), and then he had the gall to answer the phone in the middle of our transaction, have a conversation with another customer on the phone instead of putting him on hold, and then tell me that the person was a \""big client of theirs.\"" He basically insinuated that I was not at all important and that the other customer's needs came first, despite the fact that I was standing right in front of him. The only reason I'm giving this location two stars instead of one is because the other employees were okay. This Doug guy has absolutely NO business being a manager or even a management trainee. He has no idea how to treat customers, and even after all the time he spent going through my paperwork, he still managed to get my insurance claim number wrong. I will never choose to do business with this Enterprise location again."
"3","They have a good selection for party accessories and needs but right now I was browsing costumes. \n\nThey didn't even have half of it up- it's empty walls. \n\nMaybe if I need some accessories that I can't find elsewhere I'll roll by, but costumes are fairly run of the mill here. I'll probably come back for decorations instead.\n\nA-OK."
"4","Town Square is the place to be for happy hour!  With so many choices - Brio Tuscan Grille is a great place to get your grub on for cheap!\n\nTheir Tuscan Taster Menu is available in the bar area only and runs\nMonday through Friday: 3 pm to 6 pm\nSunday through Thursday: 9 pm to close\n\nAll nine of their mouthwatering items are only $2.95!!  What a steal!\n\n* Braised Meatballs & Creamy Polenta \""Topped with Marsala tomato sauce, Reggiano and parsley.\"" - Three generous sized meatballs in a tasty and tangy sauce.  The polenta is a minimal amount the covers the bottom of the dish, but a nice touch.  The Husband really enjoyed this and was about to get another!\n\n* Beef Carpaccio \""Served with field greens, capers, mustard aioli and shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.\"" - Our favorite of the ones we tried, so we got two orders.  So good and tasty, and the field greens are a nice complement to the dish.\n\n* Margherita Flatbread \""Fresh Mozzarella, vine-ripened tomatoes and fresh basil.\"" - Very basic flatbread pizza, no fancy frills here.  A nice simple crunch.\n\n* Sliced Steak Bruschetta \""With Gorgonzola Dolce, arugula, fennel, charred tomato, shaved Parmesan and Tuscan Italian dressing.\"" - Four slices of bruschetta makes this a hearty dish with the cheese and beef.  Good flavors though and sauce adds a nice sweetness.\n\nUnfortunately, their happy hour only extends to the food so there are no drink specials.  (When I called, whomever answered said there were drink specials but it wasn't so when we sat down.)  \n\nThe bartenders took our food and drink orders, and the food came out promptly.  We had no issues with service as a result unlike the other reviewers.\n\nOverall, it's a nice place and we enjoyed ourselves here.  The dining room looks like a grand hall with all the drapery.  I suggest getting your grub on here and getting drunk somewhere else if you want to save a few bucks.\n\nUpdate! 07/15/09 - Went back again last Friday and finished off the entire Tuscan Tasters menu.\n\n* Brio Burger \""A quartet of BRIO's famous Bistecca Burgers, with smoked Mozzarella and housemade chips.\"" - A very decent size burger for three bucks that was tasty and cut into four, perfect for sharing.  Chips were yummy too!\n\n* Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant \""Grilled shrimp with Romano crusted eggplant and a black pepper cream sauce.\"" - A surprise goodie!  Came with eight shrimp/eggplant stacks and definitely would definitely order again.\n\n* Sausage & Pepperoni Flatbread \""Fresh Mozzarella and housemade tomato sauce.\"" - Good pizza where they aren't shy about the toppings.\n\n* Shrimptini \""Chilled shrimp served in a martini glass with roasted tomato cocktail sauce and fresh lemon.\""  Uneventful of the bunch, fine for simple shrimp but lacks any excitement.\n\n* Roasted Red Pepper & Fresh Mozzarella Bruschetta \""With fresh basil and balsamic drizzle.\"" - Tasty bread bites with four pieces of bruschetta.\n\nThis time we went with a group of four and ordered one of everything.  It pretty much filled us for the most part, although if you're hungry, just double up on the burgers and meatballs.  We grabbed a little table this time in the bar area inside and our waitress was fine again.  It took a bit of time to get the table cleared and for the orders to go in, but nothing to complain about.  \n\nOverall, they did well again for filling our tummies on a budget!"
"2","Okay I get it it's a place from tv.... But to be honest this place isn't that amazing. First off the lady who took my order shorted me on not one but two things! And it took her 5x's as long as any other person to pack it. They need someone too double check the orders before they send it out! I mean come on they pretty much stole 10$ from us."
"4","Sometimes I feel like all I'm doing with my life is waiting. Waiting for the next job, the next promotion, the next relationship, the next benchmark that will forever sever gestation from the accolade, the rehearsal from the remuneration. And I was made vividly aware of this when I placed an order with Windy City Beefs N Pizza and had to wait for the Chicago style pizza delivered fresh to my door. It wasn't a long wait or anything, but I wondered, would I always be waiting? For my driver's license, for graduation, for my first real job, my wedding, my children, my mortal demise? Is it even possible to transcend?\n\nMaybe we should embrace the now. Maybe it's time to stop longing for Summer, 2008 and seize the day in Las Vegas. Sure, the pizza is almost nothing like Chicago's Pizzaria Uno or Giordanos, but maybe that's the way life is meant to be, and the pleasures of Chicago are, like all things, ephemeral. And maybe it's time to stop waiting, stop wining that the world gave you mashed potatoes when you really wanted french fries, accept the hand you're dealt and play it like a man! And also, eat the pizza N beefs."
"3","Second stop with our Buffet of all Buffets pass and came here for dinner. Absolutely no line which was really nice. This place is not as big as the other buffets, but after having one buffet already, I wasn't really complaining. \n\nI think overall, the food was okay. Nothing really stood out to me, but it was better than I had expected. I didn't eat too much since we were going clubbing after so this was a good place to go to just so we wouldn't be hungry later. \n\nI hated how the bathroom was outside of the dining area though and you had to walk all the way across Harrahs to get to one."
"5","Fast, fresh and low-key. Have a lot of veggie varieties as well as \""The Dagwood\"" and make you own ingrediant subs. They bread is far superior to the bland sub rolls of other sub places-you know who they are.\n\nThis is a chain with only a few locations in NC. I highly recommend the artichoke/mushroom sub. Served hot with lots of cheese and sauce!"
"4","Brisket is often a hard meat to get right, but Weiss put a nice twist on my brisket sandwich. In NY, the brisket is often crumbly, dry and lean and excellent. In the Weiss version, it is still lean (on request), but it is braised which makes it a bit moister and delicious. It still needs 1000 island dressing, but was quite tasty.  I liked the fact that you can get 1/2 sandwich and soup ($1.25 extra for matzoh ball) if your not that hungry, but the sandwiches aren't as big as Carnegie. THe soup had its moments, but was not seasoned enough, but after tossing the dark meat out of the soup (a big No No), the soup was above average and matzoh ball was giant, but needed salt. \nOnly negatives were my battle with the one fly in the place that was buzzing the back of the restaurant and no free cole slaw/pickles ala NY deli's. Rye bread was fresh too. Huge menu, so must go back and try other items including a rare sighting of an Egg Cream."
"4","I usually just get take out from here, but we like the fact that they have vegetarian and seafood options."
"4","My friends and I went here as our last dinner in Vegas. It is just so pretty and classy in there and it was a great way to end the trip with a bang :) This place is pretty pricey but hey, youve already made the trip out here and probably spent hella money. The wait wasnt that bad actually because we went on a Monday night.\n\nI got the onion soup and it was my first time having it. I was expecting it to be jam packed with flavor but I personally didnt think it was that great. The layer of cheese onion on top was too thick and I just thought it was a weird combo. I got the Filet Mignon for $32 and split with a friend since we didnt want to be bloated before heading out. The meat was super tender and tasted very buttery. I loved the frites because they were so fried and delicious. Id much rather have that than huge pieces of potatoes.\n\nThe atmosphere and the ambiance was great and the food was good but overpriced. \n\n**TIPS**\n1) I would skip out on the onion soup unless you like really like it.\n2) Dress to impress when you go here :)\n3) Enjoy!"
"5","This has to be my favorite fast food joint! I love love love their chicken! I always get their number 1 meal. It's their basic chicken sandwich with the world famous waffle fries. The customer service that you get their is stellar!  Oh, and they have the best sweet tea ever!"
"5","After moving from San Francisco, I desperately missed the farmers market 5 minutes from my house where there are all sorts of freshest fruits and vegetables. Ah, Spouts now fulfills my longing. I visited a few open \""famers market\"" here in Vegas and have been very disappointed. The selections are sad (more face painting booths than fruit/produce stands) and the price is higher than Whole Foods! (admitted by one of the stand salesperson who advised me to go to Whole Foods to buy the same thing.) The quality of the fresh produce is VERY GOOD, and they always have great sales that nobody else can beat. (Cherries for 89 cents a pound, anyone?) I tend to do most of my vegetables and fruit shopping here, but I haven't bought any meat or fish here because I usually go to Chinatown or Costco for those. Go Wednesday where they have double sales on items on sale both the previous and coming week."
"4","I looove place Milton! \nVery relaxed ambiance and friendly service. The order are always super quick to arrive and the portions generous. We used to go to Cora on Park, Place Milton replaced it. More classic then Cora, it serves 'traditionnal breakfasts'. I totally recomand this place if you are looking for an easy spot for hard week-end mornings! \nThe only downside to this place is that it is not spotless clean. \nThe also have a nice terrace in the back to enjoy your breakfast in an intimate outside spot."
"3","We went there on our honeymoon and it was an enjoyable experience .kinda fun putting on the gowns and talking to the nurse. So overall the experience of it was pretty fun got to watch a guy weigh in and since he weighed over 350 bells and lites went off cause his meal was gonna be free! The nurses were friendly and all had good sense of humor! But the food was not good at all burger was tasteless ,chili was freaking terrible fries were soggy and disgusting. Prolly won't go back but we did buy a paddle"
"4","great hotel to stay at.. we had 5 of us in the realta suite.. perfect for all of us.   tao beach was amazing.. we didnt get into club tao though.\n\n\n\nthe thing that pissed me off about this place is the 100 dollar deposit you need to give them when you check in.i didnt bring my credit card cause its bad news when i do . I was never told about that over the phone. So i was short 100 dollars in cash.    that was the only problem i had with this place....i am gonna for sure take the girlfriend next time"
"4","If Taco Bell or Acapulco is your idea of authentic Mexican food, than this place is not for you. However, if you have actually eaten off the numerous and delicious carts that line the cities of Baja, then this is your place. Enjoy!"
"5","I recently bought health insurance through Rob. He is truly an expert and made it so easy. Why go to some website that doesn't work when you can just call Rob. I highly recommend him to everybody."
"1","I'm saddened to give this a poor review. One stars is a huge overshot but zero was not possible....\n\nWe veered off from Yummy Yummy to try something more \""traditional\""....what a MISTAKE! We love Yummy Yummy, next time we'll stick with what we know....\n\nWe ordered Won Ton Soup, Chow Fun (not so fun), General Tso's Chicken and Cashew Chicken....in a nutshell, there was something wrong with every dish except for the soup, which, contrary to what I'm posting, was delicious.\n\nThe Chow Fun was very overdone, so much so that the noodles were breaking up and the vegetables in it were turning from their bright, friendly colors to a dim, sad mess....I do agree that the pork was cooked good, but it had a fishy undertone that tells me it was cooked after some fish or shrimp dish which carried over the taste into the noodles.\n\nDon't get me started on the General Tso's Chicken (soggy, drenched in sauce)....Cashew Chicken (also fishy) and even those things so simple, like deep frying the Crab Rangoon and Egg Rolls were a huge MISS! The oil (which they said was changed daily, I highly doubt, even the best restaurants with the highest table turns don't change it but once a week!)....the oil was changed daily but the food told me otherwise: dark brown in color....no better than Panda Express if you ask me.\n\nWe really put our best foot forward with ordering from China Wok. As I said, we normally order from Yummy Yummy....and have never been disappointed. Why we took a journey to an unfamiliar restaurant, I'll never know....but this insures that we are devoted to them and would sadly, never go back to China Wok unless they got their act together!"
"3","We landed and were ready for dinner. The only reason we came here was because we stayed at Paris LV and it was convenient. The price is good but the service could have been a lot better. We ordered drinks and it took forever to get them. Also some friends ordered other drinks that they never received and thankfully were not charged for. Our waitress was nice but obviously overwhelmed with how busy it was in her section as we were never checked up on. I ordered a blue cheeseburger and it was delicious. \n\nThere are better places to go while in Las Vegas. While this was not horrible it was far from great."
"1","GARBAGE... I don't understand what all the hype is about. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, so i think i know what Mexican food is suppose to taste like. I've eaten here twice because I was broke and starving and after both times I've regret it. If I want my food covered in oil i would have taken my plate to auto zone...\n  Your better off going to Faustos Mexican grill. It's right down the street off of Rainbow and Robindale.."
"2","I would have given this place 3 stars but they don't advertise on their website or menu that you only get one complimentary basket of chips and one small dish of salsa. If you want more that'll be $2.00 each time they bring you more. This was pretty much the theme of the night. I ordered the fajitas which didn't come with any cheese or lettuce, so I ordered some on the side at a cost of $1.00 each for these little cups of it. The fajita entree was $15.00 to begin with so I seriously think they could give you some cheese and lettuce to put on your tortilla. They brought me 4 tortillas with the entree and when I asked for more our waitress brought 2 for another $1.00. It might just be me but $1.00 for two corn tortillas is a bit steep. Besides for the prices this place was pretty good. It was a bit noisy but clean and the food was good just not for the price. For 3 people the bill ended up being $65.00 with one appetizer, three entrees and no drinks since we all drank water."
"4","Food was absolutely amazing. Service was quick and server's we're very helpful and knowledgeable !! Will definitely go again!!!"
"3","One of the better values in LV.  $2 20 Ounce taps 24/7.   They brew great beer and you can't beat the price.  I wish they would make a hoppy IPA someday.  Food is good and a great value.  Casino is a smoky and it's a \""locals\"" bar.   Worth checking out.  Players club has gone downhill recently and it's become much more stingy when it comes to handing out comps and givebacks."
"5","Love this place - usually go to the Ocean Club in Newport Coast.\n\nSeafood tower was received and eaten.  Fantastic.  Love the dry ice steaming down the table.\n\nDinner - split the wagyu tomahawk chop.  It was huge, but delicious.\n\nDessert - butter cake...don't bother with anything else."
"5","Great service,  great sushi, the lemonade is delicious! Blue moon on Draft also great! Would return!"
"3","I wanna gonna give 4 stars because the food was excellent BUT the service was terrible, so minus one star for that. The place was crowded and they didn't have enough waiters. When I asked the waiter to take a photo of me with the food, he said ok and never came back. When I asked for the bill, the waiter forgot. I ordered wine and they never brought it, I had to remind them that I had ordered wine.\nThe food, however, was excellent. The daal was very tasty, and the chicken tikka makni was amazing. The mixed tandoori platter seemed really popular. I saw many people order plate after plate of meat on a sizzling hot plate, so I ordered it too and it was so tender (you get chicken, shrimp and beef).\nBottomline: come here when it is not crowded."
"2","One of the only PTs where I experienced poor service with no attempt at recovery. \nMy friend and I stated when we first sat down that we were on a bit of a tight schedule and immediately ordered beers and a pizza. The pizza took 40 minutes. There were 4 other couples in the bar.\n\nThe cook brought out plates and a bar buddy 10 minutes after the order. We got excited. 15 more minutes later, we asked the bartender where the food was and he BSed his way through an explanation, then attempted to bring us more plates as a sign that the food was coming.\n\nKinda crappy. 40 minutes for a PTs pizza :(\nDon't expect much here."
"1","Once was enough. Everyone was raving so we tried it. He had breakfast and said \""meh\"" and mentioned that he couldn't tell what kind of grease the eggs had been cooked in. But no big deal. However, I had something called that if I recall was a sirloin salad-the name escape me. It was advertised as a garden salad tossed with sliced grilled sirloin. The waitress tried to warn me against the dressing it comes with, offering me a choice of another--I should have taken her up on, I think they got the dressing they used in a hunting shop-think something that might attract a bear or something. The meat was a far from sirloin as it could have been. I couldn't cut it, I couldn't chew it, I have no idea what it was. Never again."
"1","Great place for folks with fat, fat wallets.  They'll gladly relieve the strain!  I just wanted a glass of Merlot.  They promptly delivered and said, \""that comes to $19.50.  NEVER AGAIN!"
"5","My husband and I went here with my parents and we love it! They had a good price for a lunch special that gives you soup, eggroll and a big portion of your main course! The food was delicious! The service was also very good! I would recommend this place to everyone! Try it out and see what you think, but I know you won't be disappointed! :)"
"3","I went in awhile ago to see what this shop had since I LOVE to bake & am always eager to support my local bakeries. I didnt even get a chance to try the goodies because I was so turned off by the staff. The lady behind the counter seemed like she had an attitude, but hey, maybe I came on an off day. Since I have worked my fair share of customer service jobs I know it can be hard to always be cheerful, but I ended up leaving afterwards. I gave them 3 stars because I would like to come back & actually enjoy the goods. They have great reviews and ill update this when I get a chance to try it again. Im hoping I just came on an off day & that the employees aren't actually that rude."
"4","Finally something different to try. \n\nThis place is pretty great and super hard to explain. It's so light and fluffy, not like a snow cone but ice like for sure but milky however not even close to being like Ice cream, gelato or froyo. With that said, it's a must try just for the experience. They offer a great variety of toppings but nothing crazy like fruity pebbles or gummy bears. \n\nThe only thing it needed was more toppings. I would suggest asking for extra of whatever toppings you get. \n\nMy daughter chose carmel as one of her toppings and holy wow, probably the best carmel I have ever tasted...sorry churn. \n\nI can't wait to go back...I kinda want to open up my own shop on the north side of Phoenix. \n\nLoved it!"
"3","Nice local brewery that seems to be blowing up selling their beers many places. Overall the beers are good but average, the special/seasonal brews are more interesting.\n\nThe food is good especially the stuffed burgers but the rest seems average.\n\nAtmosphere is nice especially when they have live music."
"1","Some of the worst food I have had, EVER! For two we paid $30 for a measly sandwich and chips. My husband didn't like his pastrami sandwich. No flavor. I had the turkey sandwich with chips. The chips were great, the only good thing in that place. The turkey although fresh was dry, tasteless and not worth the price. I had to drown my food in mayo and mustard. The pickle on the side was a baby pickle. Wont go here again."
"2","staff was friendly and so was the crowd, but it was a special crowd.  If I'd been booking a hotel would have spend an extra 20-30 and stayed somewhere nicer.   This is a cheap hotel/extended stay and you get what you pay for."
"2","Hubie-  Love the hair bro!  I watch your show on PBS.  Anyone with a mane like that obviously knows what they're doing...which leads me to wonder how on earth you came up the portion sizes!  Fit for a mouse?  Indeed.  For man, woman, or child there just isn't enough food on the plate.\n\nThe ahi tacos were super tasty.  $13 for three itsy bitsy teeny weeny one bite tacos, are you kidding me?  I almost laughed when they came out.   If the sliders were any smaller you'd need a microscope to find the two of them.  Yeah they were good and the fries, all ten of them, were great.  The flat iron steak was also really good, as was the gumball sized baked potato and the 0.5g portion of greens.  Finally the mozzarella flat bread was decent and grossly undersized.\n\nWe sat down at 8pm on a Saturday night.  It wasn't very busy and considering the portion sizes I can't figure out why it took so long for our food to arrive.\n\nAssuming that I hit Megabucks next time I'm at Mandalay Bay I'll be back for sure.  In the mean time I'll be saving my $100 bills for somewhere with a little more food for my buck."
"5","Go Pirates!!! That's all I can say. They've made me love baseball and Pittsburgh again. They're only going to get better."
"1","Doesn't matter how good the may be, if you get bad service, the whole evening is ruined. \n\nThis was a return visit, so we knew about the limited seating. The wait was a half an hour, not something I have patience for but since we were with friends, we stuck it out. \n\nAfter we were finally seated, it was 45 minutes before we were served our entrees and then we got one by itself and the rest of the table had to wait for theirs. It would be understandable if the whole restaurant was slow, but two other tables who came in after us were served before we were. \n\nOur server kept saying \""I'm sorry for the wait\"" as her mantra.  I'm sorry, too, for a very unpleasant experience."
"2","Waited in the drive thru over ten min.  I'm actually writing this review while at the drive thru window.  Very slow. No apology or anything."
"5","I had a great experience taking my vehicle to Mike's for repair after a fender bender. I used the Geico express service - I booked the estimate and repair online for the next day. When I dropped off my car, they were expecting me, it took less than 30 minutes and every single person I encountered at the shop was helpful and friendly and showed concern for me. The damage was minor, and the repairs took less than 48 hours to complete. My policy provides a rental car, and Enterprise was there when I checked in with my vehicle and the rental process was streamlined and easy. When I picked up my repaired car, it was just as efficient and friendly. Getting into an accident is frustrating and inconvenient and costly but Mike's Auto Body made the process of fixing things and getting me back on the road into a good experience. I wish more businesses treated their customers like Mike's treated me."
"1","Kept waiting in a line for a Buffett at entrance for 20 minutes ... No excuses!!!)\n\nDumb dumb"
"2","The fiance was craving cheese steaks and our local burger/sandwich joint is closed on Sundays. So, we decided to try out DeFalco's. Reading the reviews, I saw that the wait time is sometimes an issue, so I called in our order in advance. The order consisted of 1 whole cheese steak w/ everything and 1 half w/ everything. \n \nUpon arrival, I was given the total of $21 and some change. Having seen the online menu with pricing, I was prepared for the bill to be somewhere around $15, so I was a little shocked when I was told it was over $20. I verified the order with the man and found that I was charged for and made one extra whole sandwich. I told the cashier that the order was incorrect, to which he said \""I was the one who took the phone order and it was for 2 whole and 1 half sandwiches.\"" He proceeded to grab the order slip and show me. I replied, \""Well, I'm the person who called in the order and specifically asked for 1 whole for my finance and 1 half for myself.\"" He stood there after my explanation as if expecting me to pay for the additional sandwich. After he realized that I was not going to pay for his mistake, he took the second whole sandwich back and rerang the bill. The new total came to $13.00+ tax, an amount within the range I was expecting to pay. \n \nEven though the sandwiches were delicious, we are hesitant to return. We may try DeFalco's again, only next time as walk-in customers"
"3","Decent food, great service, modern d\u00e9cor.  \n\nBelgian waffle was light and tasty, mimosas were okay (a little tart for my taste), bacon slightly undercooked, eggs were light and fluffy (asked for scrambled/well done), and hash browns were okay.\n\nOverall, we were happy enough and plan on returning to try some other menu options."
"3","Four floors of M&Ms & M&Ms merch. Yup that's about it. This place gets a big ol \""Meh...\"" from us. If you're asylum-ready insane over M&Ms (I think I actually know one of these people) then this is your heaven, hell, mother, & future all in a candy-coated shell. For the rest of the populace, you may find yourself thinking \""I had no idea there was so much M&M merch in the entirety of the universe...\"" or \""Who would buy this stuff???\"". Well, there is & there are."
"5","I've been using Automated for a few years now and they have provided us with great solutions and service.  If your looking to automate your digital lifestyle give them a try."
"3","Try the grilled pork sandwich, or was it roast pork? I can't remember, but it was really good. However,  I did not care for the Vietnamese stuffed bao or bread."
"3","First time here despite the mixed reviews on Yelp.  The first thing I did was to check the cleanliness of the flatware as one Yelper suggested after having a \""dirty\"" experience.  Everything ok on that end.  \nThe orders included The sampler which provided coconut shrimp, balls of sweet and sour chicken, pot stickers and eggs rolls.  The stand out item were the egg rolls, followed by the sweet and sour chicken, shrimp and pot stickers.  Pot stickers were missing some flavors especially ginger.  Dipping sauce had little ginger to help the pot stickers along so I would not order potstickers here.  \nAlso had Strawberry-Ginger Chicken Salad.  Generous portion but I did not find it flavorful.  I found two things missing--the ginger flavor and the chicken.  Would not order this again. The mongolian beef and the mandarin orange were well prepared as was the  five vegetable fried rice.  Just the right amount of sesame oil without the saltiness that often is characteristic of fried rice.  The Thai spicy shrimp dish was not spicy and there was nothing Thai about it.  No thai flavors to speak of.  The green beans that accompanied the shrimp were nicely done--still a bit crunchy instead of being overcooked.  The service was fine.  \nI think the issue with Bamboo Club is the pricing.  Very high prices, and in some cases, double of what would be charged at your average or even higher end Chinese restaurant.  I think calling it an \""Asian Bistro\"" does not warrant those high price points. \nThe decor seems tired but I am not rating on decor since I don't eat decor.  But I have to say that when you charge high prices, the client expects a nice place to eat along with great food."
"5","My friend and I went here on a whim to fulfil our shabu shabu craving. The decor made this place feel as though I was in a real Japanese restaurant; close seating and very small. The  service was  really good, checking up on us regularly. The food was amazing. Everything looked very fresh from the vegetables to the meat and seafood.  This place is definitely a great place. If you want shabu shabu with an authentic feel you really have to try this place out."
"4","Lots of equipment. Super cheap memberships- and the trainers/staff don't bother you at all, which is nice. I can fiddle around with a weight machine like an idiot for 5 minutes without anyone giving me dirty looks- which is awesome. \nEven at peak hours this location still isn't too crazy! Lots of open machines. My only complaint are the lame-o's that just want to post on a piece of equipment for like 15 minutes. You do not need that much time to cool down from your reps! GTFO!"
"2","My family has ordered take-out from the Green Mango twice -- and both were rather botched. The first time I went to pick up our food and they had not prepared my dish because they were out of an ingredient. The waitress insisted that she had called me several times (basically impossible given that my cell phone was on and in my pocket) and was indignant, rather than apologetic. There was no apology, no suggestion that I should get the dish free, get a free Thai tea, etc. Her attitude was quite bad and I had to wait while they cooked a different dish of my choosing.\n\nThe second experience was largely the same. I showed up and gave them my name -- they couldn't find it by my name, so they had to look it up based on what dishes I ordered. Only one of the three dishes was correct. Rather than Chicken Pad Thai, it was Chicken Satay. Rather than King Chicken, it was Prik Khing curry. The waiter said, \""Your order is not ready yet\"" even though I could see on the computer screen that it was wrong. When I asked how long it would be, he said, \""15 minutes.\"" I asked whether there had been a mistake and he said, \""Your order was wrong.\"" Again, no apology; he had a salty attitude and made no attempt to repair their mistake.\n\nI could set these issues aside to some extent if the food were good. But it's largely mediocre. The Pad Thai is on the sweet and bland side (not enough bright tamarind flavor), is light on bean sprouts, and has none of the fresh bite (e.g., cilantro) that I expect from Pad Thai. The Pad See Ew is a poor excuse for that dish -- no rich dark soy flavor, minimal broccoli, heavy on noodles. The curries are a bit better and I thought the green curry was well balanced and had a good spiciness. The price gouging for brown rice over white rice is stupid.\n\nStill, the noodle dishes are better at Bangkok Balcony (other stuff seems more variable, but is usually good) and everything I've had at the Smiling Banana Leaf has been much superior to Green Mango. Given the poor quality of the service at the Green Mango, we won't order (or go) there again. I would recommend Bangkok Balcony or Smiling Banana Leaf over Green Mango, both in terms of service and in terms of food quality."
"4","Probably the best All you can eat  sushi in the east side"
"4","Thank goodness this place has occupied the unfortunate corner of short-lived restaurants. There is nothing worse than giving a place a chance, getting attached to it and then it shutting down shortly thereafter. Luckily, America's Taco Shop has a loyal following and I sincerely hope it stays put in the 7th Ave location. Last night was my 4th time here and it grows on me more and more. Had I wrote this review the first time I went (7th St location), I think I would have given it 3 stars. I mean, to state that it has the best carne asada? I still wouldn't go that far but I always enjoy my food. Last night, I had a carne asada taco, pastor taco, and chips/salsa/guacamole. I love pastor tacos but am not a fan of theirs. They add pineapple to theirs which is my thing. I love pineapple alone, not warm with food. Again, not my thing. I have had their carne asada tostada in the past. I was a little turned by the warm, wilted lettuce on top but I guess that is what happens when it is wrapped with foil. But the tostada was okay. Their bean and cheese burritos are awesome. It is so simple but the flavor is really good...love it. I haven't eaten there in person (we always get take-out) but from the outside, the restaurant is adorable and oh-so inviting. My daughter's day care is right across the street and this place is always busy. Good sign...."
"3","Went today for early lunch.\nService was scarce. We were seated, then no one came around. \nWe walked up to a cafateria style service. Order at the counter.\nYou pay by the1/4  pound, we shared a 1/4lb ea.  of brisket, ham and ribs all\n $ 4.75.'lb +-\nplus 3/4 lb of roasted chicken plus 2 small sides beans and cole slaw.\nTotal $39.00 + tx\nBeware the food cost add up quickly. Order slowly and ask before you commit on anything , your meat choice. They will weigh it in front of you.\nFood - 5 STARS - Excellent BBQ, if you miss Salt Lick , this is as close as your gonna get. Sides were good too.\nNo Sauce on Meats you add at table.\nService - 1 STAR-  needs help, or make self serve.\n\nPark in the back off Frank Sinatra and Reno . Walk in , near sports book."
"1","I am from Dallas, and their stores are MUCH more organized!! It was ridiculous and unsafe how high they had the bed-in-a-bags stacked!! I love Anna's but will NEVER go back to this store unless they get some good employees to do their job and organize the store!"
"3","9/22/13 My wife and I stopped in to the Tornado Steak House for a late dinner.  They have a half chicken with stuffing, mashed potatoes, and green bean special every  Sunday.  That's what I ordered.  It was wonderful.  My wife had the duck.  It's one of her favorite dishes when visiting.   I'm giving them 3 stars because of consistency issues.  Sometimes I love the food and other times not so much.  Last night was a good night!  Regarding service our waiter was eccentric at best.  That's all I'm going to say about that."
"5","Epic!! Mind-Blowing!! AmAzInG!! are the words I'm using to describe my experience with Fukuburger. I tried It outside Insert Coins after a night of heavy bar hopping and was COMPLETELY HYPNOTIZED by the Intoxicating smell coming from a very bright colored food truck, so much so that I think I may have been floating to the truck while under my trance....."
"4","My SO and I decided to try Circle H BBQ Sunday afternoon.  It is clean and friendly.\nI ordered BBQ chicken and my partner had the pulled pork.  Both sandwiches were very good.  My partner cannot eat gluten and the waitress informed us that most of the items on the menu are gluten free.  They have a variety of sandwiches and sides such as slaw, baked beans , fries , potato salad.etc.  We had the potato salad and again we both liked it.  Prices range from $8-$10 \nI will definately eat here again."
"1","Do not go here. I walked in for lunch and the guy at the front was on his cell phone the entire time he was taking my order and never said a word to me except how much my meal cost. Not tomention he barely spoke English. Also, they were out of jalape\u00f1o wraps. How can a place that specializes in wraps be out of them? Extremely rude and I will not be back."
"3","I'll start by saying that I am an avid visitor at Bambini's and greatly enjoy their food. The best garlic knots as well as best tasting pasta (marinara is fantastic) in town that I've found so far. I gave Bambini's 3 stars for a couple different reasons... Service isn't very consistent between different servers, and one particular reason that made me want to write this review... First of all, if you are unaware, most meals come with a side of bread (or you can substitute for 4 garlic knots) only problem is they do not tell you nor ask that there is this side that comes with most meals.\n\nThe first few times I had eaten at Bambini's we had ordered just our pasta dishes and nothing else and eventually became curious to why there wasn't some kind of side that came with our dishes.... until I asked that is. Ever since then I have had to 'remind' the waiter/waitress that we would like our side of garlic knots with our dishes which I think is completely ridiculous. \n\nI just ordered 2 dishes to go over the phone last night and asked if they would substitute the bread for the knots and the waitress replied \""Yes!\"". At which point when I picked up the food I was skeptical if they had really had given me the knots I had asked for and they gave me a bag which had a smaller bag inside (which I thought the knots were in) as well as 2 containers with pasta in them. Seeing that smaller bag made me think those must be the knots but only to realize when I finally arrive home that this smaller bag had a loaf of bread in it which was incredibly disappointing considering that I live a distance away from Bambini's. It almost seems that they don't want to give sides to any dishes but they put no voice towards it. Of course I have no idea if this is true it is my observation.\n\nRemember, ASK for the side of bread or garlic knots along with your dish or the only food that arrives will be your dish only."
"5","So when I started yelping I pretty much told myself I would never write a review for a chain because let's be honest - they all seem to be the same. The only exceptions would be a terrible experience or a really great experience. Luckily this Starbucks is a latter.\n\nThis Starbucks is in a great location, has a phenomenal outdoor seating area (some under a roof, other parts out in the open), and the staff is SPECTACULAR! Unlike many of the other starbucks in the area where I find myself waiting a whole lot - this starbucks gets you through the line quick drink in hand! They've always been super friendly and interact with you more than just \""what can I get started for you today.\"" Such a great experience every time I've been there!\n\nI am by no means a regular at the moment since I don't get into the area very often but the fact that some of the employees are already starting to remember my drink is pretty darn impressive!!\n\nRandom comment: As a Starbucks Gold card holder (with name printed on the card) isn't it weird that they ask for my name as they're holding the card in their hand? Seems kind of repetitive to me personally. (Doesn't effect my review just wanted to throw it out there into the universe)"
"2","The staff was very nice, efficient and friendly.  The place was very clean and interesting.  They are getting only two stars because the Iced Chai Tea Latte I got was mostly water.  It would have been stronger had I filled a glass with ice, poured the tea over it and let all the ice melt.  \n\nI don't mind paying $4 for a small glass of Tea (Okay, I do mind, but obviously I'll do it anyway!) but I do expect it to actually be Tea and not barely flavoured water.  \n\nI'll go back and try again but for now two stars is all I can give them.  Oh and their chairs can also double as torture devices."
"1","I conducted a last-minute small meeting at this location and without a doubt will not be conducting anymore meetings here.\n\n1) The meeting rooms are on the 3rd floor & the bathrooms are on the 1st... do the math.\n\n2) Nobody checked on us the entire day to make sure everything was acceptable. I guess they knew it wasn't!\n\n3) The AC unit in the meeting room was so loud that we had to turn it off and suffer through a hot meeting.\n\nThe Sales Manager followed up with me and really didn't have anything to say, except for she wished that I would have found her to tell her about the AC unit. She couldn't say anything else and my guess is that she knew that the meeting rooms were substandard.\n\nI am having another meeting (larger) next month at the Doubletree, but at the one in South Park. Hopefully it will be A LOT better, then again, can't get much worse!\n\nUpdate: the meeting at the Southpark location was great. They exceeded expectations and will be booking with them again."
"3","This was home base for 4 nights during our trip to AZ.  The hotel was alright...nothing bad but nothing great about it either.  \n\nPros-Comfy bed, free wireless internet, free business center to print things out, free parking and only $50 bucks a night....oh yeah...pretty centrally located right off Scottsdale Blvd.\n\nCons-Pool was closed, small bathrooms,  walls are pretty thin....we had a band that was touring or some shit staying next to us and we could hear them all hours of the day.\n\nWould I stay again?  Maybe."
"4","Mannnnn, I'd LOVE to get invited out on a date here!\n\nI mean, it's perfectly adorable and ever-so-vintage. You've got antique decor (though oddly, they don't feel antique here - it just feels like you've stepped back in time and the whole world is like that), yummy ice cream cones and shakes, candies from yesteryear (with prices to match!), and a friendly staff.\n\nI found this place via a LivingSocial coupon, which truly worked since I never would've known about it otherwise. Klavon's is tucked away in a somewhat deserted part of the Strip District, surrounded by abandoned industrial storefronts. I had the chocolate chip cookie dough cone, which in itself was pretty good, though not amazing. The milkshake and old-school candy? Totally awesome! Highly recommend due to the super sweet (no pun intended) step-back-in-time ambiance and homey feel.\n\nNow all you need is a hot date and a poodle skirt, right?!"
"4","We tried this restaurant when we were in Las Vegas.  We had a group of eight.   The service here is great, very attentive and friendly.\n\nI had the chicken kiev which was crisp on the outside and juicy on the outside.  I had a cranberry cabbage salad that came with it which to me wasn't very flavorful, I would have preferred the red cabbage that others had.  \n\nOther members of our group ordered the pork, which was kind of dry.  The steak was good.  I had the mashed potatoes with my dinner instead of fries but I wish I would have ordered the fries.  They were home made, flavorful and delicious.\n\nWe had the cabbage rolls, herring and vegetable plate.   \nOthers in the group loved the cabbage rolls, me, not so much.  The herring was outstanding,  fresh and not too oily.  I was going to order the salmon but our server suggested the herring and I'm glad I took her advice.  The vegetable plate was displayed  beautifully   and everything on it was fresh.   The desserts were great as well\n\nOverall, the food was good , the service was excellent and the price was very reasonable.\n\nThe only downside to our visit is that when we exited we were accosted by a man who asked one of our party members \""to borrow 50 cents\"" .  It was a very unpleasant experience and I rwon't go into furhter details, but there is a liquor store in the same plaza and there were quite a few people loitering outside."
"5","I love it here!  The atmosphere is awesome and the lanes are great!  It's a great family place to bring your kids too.  The have a food bar as well so if you get hungry and can just get a quick snack."
"4","Very good food. Great variety of Greek and Meditteranean dishes to choose from. The Gyros are amazing and I LOVE the meat lovers platter. I highly recommend this place . You won't regret it."
"3","Up until recently, Burger King had probably the worst coffee in the world. After seeing TV ads for a \""New\"" coffee that the fast food giant was offering, I decided to partake in all the hub bub. It also didn't hurt that for this promotional period, they would be offering 25c small coffees for a couple weeks (Note: at the time this review is being written, this deal has expired, so they are normal price). The new coffee was OK. It wasn't exceptionally strong as a DD, but it didn't taste like what you would get at a jiffy lube while you are waiting for your car to be serviced. It had an extremely mild flavor. I don't like this location because when you are trying to head out in either direction on Serene Ave, it feels like a death trap, with a steady stream of cars coming from both sides on this busy street."
"1","My dinner:\n3 or 4 bites or various appetizers\n2 slabs of tofu with a single bunch of enoki mushrooms and 5 asparagus tips\n1 mochi ball\n1 glass of Luna Freakout\nMy bill including gratuity:\n$62.00\n\nSeriously, this place is a pain in the ass. The menu is designed to be served over a number of courses from different sections of the menu. There are cold appetizers, hot appetizers, salads, hot dishes, main entrees and dim sum. Mind you, if you order something from the hot appetizer and cold appetizer sections, they will not come out at the same time. The kitchen is not designed for that , I'm told. The server and back waiters tend to you to the point that it's distracting from your meal. I LOVE good service, but really, come on. If I spend more time telling the servers thank you than I do talking to my friends, it's too much.The food was mediocre at best, and the prices are ridiculous for what you get. As Helen said, Boo on Woo."
"4","I love pizza. any pizza. Don't take my opinion on it.\n\n$5 for slice, and $5 for a draft beer."
"5","The chips and dip are deliciousssss. Basically anything on the menu is bomb.com"
"1","Yes it's a legit place, but facial was horrible! Limp hands and after several request for a normal touch, Zora did not oblige. No clue how to make client at ease! Will never visit this place again!"
"5","I've been there twice. Once with Mom, once with my girlfriend. Each experience was unique. Each experience provided superb service and fantastic food. Go there to enjoy a meal for a beautiful evening out."
"4","Quality Buffett. Go for Sunday brunch if you want the good stuff."
"1","I use to eat here all the time. At first the food was great, I would call up and it would be a big order and they would tell me 30-45 minutes which is pretty standard. After some time though my orders wouldn't change the time it would take to come pick up my food became less and less. Down from 30-45 minutes to 10 minutes. The food quality went down and it didn't taste fresh anymore, I even thought that the flavors and quality were so poor I would compare it to microwaved Chinese food. The last time we went there was probably about a month before the news came out about their sanitary conditions. We ordered some Hong Kong style noodles, chicken wings, and hunan beef. It was all delivered fairly quickly, but it was disgusting. We didn't even bother finishng our food, not even one dish was half eaten. The hunan is supposed to be crunchy (which we get delivery often and it is at least slighty crunchy), but this time it was soggy and greasy. The noodles were greasy and the sauce was sub par. Now the nasty... My girlfriend got the chicken wings they were dry, old tasting, and multiple pieces of the chicken had holes. Now when I say holes I don't mean maybe they poked a hole to inject flavor or the skin got burned off, more so it looked like the skin rotted or it was a mistreated low quality chicken. It was just so unappetizing that was the last time we ever ate there. I do not recommend this place. I've gone in before and a server was eating her lunch at a table from a food pan. One word to describe this place prior to be exposed is unsanitary. I haven't returned after they got a good grade, because my experience with them was disgusting. It sucks cause I really use to love this place."
"4","Im a fan of this place, food has been consistently good when i come here.  It is inside the casino and it does loose some authentic ambiance but hey your in vegas.  Ive tried only a small portion of the menu but so far so good."
"2","I really would love to love Lappert's. I just don't. It's OK, doesn't suck, hey it's ice cream which rarely sucks. I had been in Lamperts several years ago, and didn't remember it being all that spectacular. After seeing all the great reviews on yelp, thought I'd give it another go. I tried the the Caramel Coconut Macadamia Nut which was dripping with so much caramel it completely overpowered the macadamia and coconut. I even noticed the server scooping away gobs of caramel off to one side of the bucket as she made my cone, that's how much was in there. I don't know if it was a fluke, a bad batch or what, but I swear it was like eating a cone full of caramel. I tried the Manila Mango too, also just OK. Knowing that mangos from the Philippines rock, and suspecting it was not really made from Manila mangos, I asked the gal behind the counter (who was Philipina) if it was really made with Manila mangos, and she said no. So kind of a strike against Lapperts simply for lying. I will say the portions are huge, a single scoop is really more like 2, so from a quantity/price standpoint, it's a pretty smokin' deal. The people behind the counter were friendly, service was fast, the place had a constant flow of people in and out, so people clearly like this place. Maybe mango isn't my flavor, and maybe the batch of Caramel Coconut Macadamia Nut was off that day, I would give it another try, but so far, not so impressed."
"3","Another week, another Squirrel Hill Chinese restaurant to try.  Seriously, there's practically one for every week of the year.  How Lee was our choice because we had an AllMenus coupon code for $10 off, so that was essentially a free entree.  Sold!  We ordered a scallion pancake, which I haven't had in years and was essentially dreaming about all this time, the Triple  Szechuan Delight (shrimp, beef, vegetables in \""brown sauce\""), and chicken fried rice because we're cool.\n\nWhen we went to pick it up, the place was PACKED.  Lots of Asian families eating big pots of delicious looking food, and lots of white people standing around waiting for take out.  Sounds like this is one of those places with an American menu, and a Chinese menu.  We are pretty adventurous eaters typically, but since this was our first time at How Lee, we figured we'd start simple.  We waited about 10 more minutes after getting there, and I had to fight through the crowds to get to the front to pick up my food.  So it took about 25 minutes total for the food to be ready - kind of a while, but given the crowd I'm not surprised.\n\nWe took the food home, and nommed it.  I loved the scallion pancake - they're really simple and I've never had one that was different than any other, but the greasy, crispy consistency keeps me coming back.  Yum!  Fried rice was okay - I've had it better at other places (I think I liked it a lot at Pacific Ring).  My boyfriend really liked the Szechuan dish - it was only a little bit spicy, and the sauce did have the glossy Chinese food consistency, but the taste was pretty good.  Portions were big and lasted us for several meals.\n\nMaybe next time we'll try something a little more adventurous, and hopefully be rewarded with deliciousness!"
"4","Eaten both at the restaurant and got delivery. \n\nDelicious. We have had  pizza, breadsticks, beer, and hot wings and I have to say they give chains a run for their money. \n\nNot to far from Zipps, or Sushi Eye they do a lunch special that is amazing and with the amazing weather come have a beer on the patio. \n\nThis place is really good, staff is friendly, and polite, they are always advertising some great deals so check them out you won't be disappointed."
"3","Nice suite with in room spa. The beds are very comfortable like home. Room is big with it's own dining area,  living room, 2 TV,  Bose surround system and home like amenities\nThe bid thumb down is the awful cigarette smell.  My family and i had one year of our  life gone in smoke.    I recommend to this Hotel to smokers only and keep kids away from there."
"4","I stayed in the hotel for a night while passing through town on a road trip.  We had a deluxe king bedroom and it was very comfortable, just what we need after a few days on the road.  The room has a lot of electronics; there are controls for the lights, curtains, music, tv, and lock on the touch pad by the bed.  It took a few minutes to figure everything out, but in the end it was nice.  The bed was very comfortable and the turndown service and chocolates were a nice surprise. The hotel food options were quite expensive and I was glad we had received a $100 food credit for our stay.  We ate at buffet for both dinner and breakfast since the price of the buffet was close to the price of an entr\u00e9e at one of the restaurants and it came with unlimited wine and drinks at dinner.  Both times the service and food was great.  The variety of food was extensive at both meals.  Our only complaint was the check-in and check-out procedures.  For both we encountered a long wait.  The $25 resort fee also seems a little much for Internet and the other amenities it provides for."
"5","It is ALL about the Aromatherapy Scrub & Massage at Imperial Health Spa. But brace yourself, bitches. There's no gentle, relaxing touch involved so if that's your thing, don't even bother reading any more of my review. The hearts and rainbows and jumping unicorns and rose petals are just not the type of things that transpire over at the Korean Spa. So if you're a bad ass like me and you're from the school that whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger, do feel free to read on... \n\nThey will scrub you within an inch of your life and elbow the shit out of knots in your back but it's sooo worth it! No pain no gain baby! Brunhilda from Ryan and Sean's Not So Excellent Adventure has nothing on the chicks that work here! If you don't get that reference, don't feel bad. It's just some obscure, cheesy movie that I happen to have acted in so I wouldn't expect you to have any idea what I'm talking about. And if you do get it... I'm impressed! Extra cool points in my book for you!\n\nCome earlier than your appointment time. Like half an hour early minimum. They want you to be human soup with the rest of the nudists that enjoy the facilities here pre-scrub/massage. Oh and jump into that steam room for a few too if you can handle it. I can't take it too long though. I get wayyy too hot! *insert cute boys sending me compliments like \""Yeah, that's right, you ARE way too hot!\"" here*\n\nMy suggestion is to come here before an airbrush tanning session. Get all that dead skin off your body and then head over to see Terry over at Bronzed. But actually the ideal thing is to do this the day or two before because they put a bunch of hardcore moisturizer/oil on you which is not good to have on your skin before an airbrush tanning session because it will make it so the tanner doesn't stick and defeat the whole purpose of your doing the scrub in the first place.\n\nThey do just about everything that can be done to pamper you here during this treatment. And there are two different options. One's $125 and the other is $150. Only difference between the two is that one is longer than the other. The Aromatherapy Scrub and Massage appointment goes as follows:\n\nYour scrubber/massage lady comes and finds you in the steam room or jacuzzi. You go back with her and get completely nude. She scrubs the hell out of you as you contemplate your escape route and/or start thinking of a way you can start climbing the ceiling. She shows you all the nasty skin she has taken off of you and you're like, \""Wow! I guess I definitely needed this! I swear I don't live in a cardboard box under a freeway overpass!\"" Then she washes you with this pineapple smelling soap and one of those poof things. This is one of my favorite parts of the treatment because the scent is very intense and smells amazing! After that they wash your hair for you and condition it while giving you a bit of a head massage. Then they seat you up and give you some soap for your face and have you go get in the shower while they clean up all your dead skin off the table so everything is nice and clean for the massage portion that is coming up next. After your shower, they hand you a towel and have you lay down on the table face down. Then they dry you off some more and begin the massage. After that they flip you over and massage a little more, then put a mask on your face. While the mask is drying, they massage your neck and shoulders. Then they peel the mask off and that's the end of your aromatherapy scrub and massage treatment. \n\nAll in all it is a great experience that I recommend and partake in often. So if you see me running around naked 'round these parts, don't be surprised. And sorry dudes... it's not co-ed in the naked area although the men do have their own birthday suit section at this spa. No clue what goes on back there so you're on your own there, buddy. To all the ladies out there... Maybe say hi or something if you see me... Or not. Cuz that like might be awkward since we're like naked and stuff. I dunno... I'm pretty easygoing so if you don't mind, I won't. Your call either way, fellow yelpers. \n\nAll I know is this... You will leave here glowing and looking fantastic, feeling like a new woman! This place is the bomb diggity and the sheer number of checkins I have listed above should speak volumes about how much I love this place!"
"3","I had a pasta dish, which was below average.  Cream sauce was flavorless and kielbasa was unappetizing.  However, the fish and chips are above average.  Four large pieces of fish and very filling.  Chips are thin fries. I'd order the fish and chips again, but I'd stay away from the pasta.  So far, this place seems like hit or miss, depending on what you order.\n\nEdit:  \n1. Tartar sauce comes in packets, as opposed to made fresh.  The freshly made stuff is in the nearby Bistro.  \n2.  I also tried the gumbo, which is a special this month.  Not good at all relating to both taste and appearance.  Rice was very soggy.  I posted photos of both the fish and chips and gumbo."
"4","Since Whiskey River wasn't serving alcohol anymore we went over to Wild Wings. There wasn;t anyone at the door so we weren't sure if they were still open but we went to the bar. Our bartender was very nice and the drinks were good.  The place is big and the whole staff seemed nice."
"5","It is every girl's worst nightmare...finding a new hairstylist. I have been faced with this daunting task for a couple of months now. After asking for peer references, I was referred to Ally at Saskia. I quickly made an appointment and am so glad I did! \n\nThe salon itself has only been open for a short time. The decor is comforting, the ambiance relaxing and all staff members are very friendly. At the risk of sounding dated, I have learned that a business that provides good customer service is certainly one worth returning to. I was also appreciative of the Audrey Hepburn movies playing in the back room :)\n\nAlly was a delight and obviously very good at what she does. After doing a quick initial meeting, we got to work on fixing my starved-for-attention hair. I have very thick and finicky hair--this seemed to be no problem for my new fabulous stylist. After my partial highlight and cut, I happily paid my bill knowing that it was well worth the services rendered. Looking forward to my next appointment at this up and coming salon!"
"2","Having been a member of several gyms over the past forty years this one is by far the worst. Whilst the facilities and equipment are all very good, with the exception of the atrocious spin bikes, it's the management that's terrible - useless might be a better description. Two years ago they finally replaced the spin bikes that were constantly breaking with new ones that are even worse than the previous ones. In doing so they also cut back the total number so that quite often the room is full and people are turned away. A few weeks ago my wife could not get her spin shoe out of the clip (she's not the only one) and had to take her foot out of the shoe. I struggled to get it out and it broke. After two e-mails to the club about this she had no response at all so she left a hard copy letter which finally got a response - \""It's your shoes fault\""! Nobody even asked to look at her shoes to determine the problem. Yesterday I could not get my shoe out and it also broke. I got the same response - \""It's your shoes fault\""!\nLast year they arbitrarily and without permission started charging an \""Enhancement Fee\"" however none of us can see any enhancements whatsoever and in fact the whole club continues to deteriorate.  Have you ever heard of a business that actually charges it's customers to invest in itself? Management seems oblivious to the problems and complaints. \n\nOn the very positive side the desk staff and trainers are all wonderful which is why I gave Mountainside an extra star."
"4","Beautiful hotel to stay at For an affordable price!!!!"
"2","Maybe they had a off day.The food here was pretty bad. The chicken in the fried rice looked like it was meat left over from other meals. I guess next time I order from here I'll try something different. If I do."
"1","Do not stay here. Awful. As though it's not shabby enough with the slowest \""service\"" in the daytime, a never-ending emergency alarm starts going off at 430  AM. False Alarm."
"1","If you are a vegetarian DO NOT go here!!!\n\nMy wife went there with a friend and brought me home take out. She asked if they had Gen. Tso TOFU (stress - TOFU). They said they do not but that they could make some.\n\nHow awesome right? WRONG - they were too stupid to actually make it. \n\nWell if you're a meat eater this next part might not seem too important but if you're not you'll understand - she paid for and they sent her off with CHICKEN! That's right c h i c k e n, chicken. Disgusting dirty bird parts. When I opened the container I nearly puked. The stench of dead birds permeated our apartment and we both began to gag. \n\nSo we paid for a big bowl of dead rotting animal parts. I'd like to have our money back but I'm not going to drive all the way back out there for it - I just wish these idiots could understand what a disgusting mistake they made. I'm sure it was just a mistake but it's one that you should NEVER make when it comes to serving those that don't eat flesh. \n\nClearly a mistake like this shows that they have little regard for peoples dietary needs. I can only assume that even if they got it right they may have cross-contaminated it with dead animal parts. If you are a vegetarian DO NOT go here!!!"
"3","I've come to this Native New Yorker for a few years now and I must say, the wings taste better and better every time I come. The wings are so moist and tender that it falls right off the bone. I love the asiago and honey hot, those are my must have wings when we're here and the spinach artichoke dip is by far the best I've ever had.  \n\nCustomer service has always been either horrible or just plain \""ok\"". I've never had stellar customer service here, but we continue to come because of the food."
"2","I don't know much about cars, so I usually get 2nd or 3rd opinions elsewhere before I decide whom I go to get my car repaired. This place happened to be the first, and they quoted me something that was waaaay out of my budget. I went to the second place and they told me something totally different. Long story short, I went with second place. Besides, I wasn't too comfortable with their sales tactics. Like I said, I'm not even a novice when it comes to cars, so I don't really know if they were telling me the truth or not, but if I were you, I would dust off the lie detector and bring that with me."
"3","The half off for early lunch and at late night is really worth it, but I'm not sure I would come at other times. I usually prefer the early lunch because the late night can get really crowded, but sometimes that's half the fun. The beer here, and alcohol here in general, is really really cheap. There's always some kind of special for $1 or $2. It's also awesome that they have shots called \""Taylor Swift\"" and \""Miley Cyrus.\"" \n\nI've tried a few of their pasta dishes,and have always been unimpressed. Their burgers and fries, however, are very delicious, and at half-off run at only $4 to fill you up! My friend insists that yelp needs to have more subcategories for bars, and classifies this as a college bar, not a dive bar. I guess it's true, probably 98% of their customers are college students from around Pittsburgh, and probably 80% of them are Pitt students."
"5","If you are looking for fun, unique, challenging (both mentally and physically), total body workout look no further than Surfset! The entire class is based around core muscle control and getting a killer workout in while - you guessed it - balancing on a surfboard! Resistance bands are positioned on the sides of the boards so if you don't start of being a professional (ha!) you can take baby steps to get there. This concept is truly genius. \n\nThis was (and definitely would be in the future) a fun class to take as a group. It is laid out similar to a dance studio but with surfboards everywhere...however the mirrors everywhere help you to see that you are not alone in occasionally taking a nose dive off the board. ;) It's really a motivating and encouraging group atmosphere.\n\nThe instructor and owner, Jason, was very easy to work with and helpful. I would highly recommend this class!\n\nThank you Surfset and Yelp for putting on such a fun event!"
"4","Buying a Groupon can often be a crap shoot. I had heard good things about Custom Built Pizza before the Groupon became available so I was pretty confident about the purchase. \n\nAfter a long day of shopping and running errands, my fella and I decided to get a bite to eat before heading home. Having spent a pretty penny on all purchases, we decided the best idea was to use on of the many Groupons I have pending. We arrived at Custom Built and were greeted warmly and instructed on the ordering process. \n\nMy fella and I both got our own personal sized pizzas and proceeded to select our toppings of choice. They have some great sauces to choose from. The staff encouraged us to sample them before choosing. I tried the highly recommended spicy diavalo sauce and chose the pretty typical offerings of pepperoni, basil, mushrooms, olives, sun dried tomatoes and lots and lots of mozzarella cheese. I love the concept and the ingredients are really fresh and tasty. Their dough is handmade and you can taste it. I was surprised by how great my pizza turned out.  Since it was my first visit, I erred on the side of caution, but I look forward to my next visit where I plan on being a little more adventurous with my toppings and trying their whole wheat dough as well as one of their dessert pizzas."
"5","Our visit to Addiction at the Rumor Hotel in Las Vegas was one of the greatest dinning experiences of our lives.  From the minute we walked in, the staff was helpful and attentive. Ben, who runs the restaurant and bar, was fantastic, with great recommendations and suggestions.  \n\nThe Short Rib appetizer was amazing, so tender, and matched perfectly with the Sweet Potato Puree and honey port sauce.  Karmal Pork (Ben's suggestion) was the best, most perfectly cooked porkchop I've ever had, and I'm a big fan of pork.  The sauce was just the right amount of sweet and savory.  The Salmon was also perfectly cooked.  \n\nThe atmosphere was so relaxed, dinning on the patio in the evening was the perfect way to start a night in Vegas.  And chatting outdoors on the patio couches with locals we met, over drinks and deep fried Nutter Butters, led to the best night in Vegas.  It's unbelievable the such great food and atmosphere can be found in Vegas at such good prices.  From now on my trips to Vegas will include a Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner at Addiction, and probably reservations at the Hotel too."
"2","For a speedy, cheap lunch, it's tolerable. As Asian food goes, Yeesh, I sure hope not."
"3","There are two types of people; those who can get past lackluster service, and those who can't. 5-stars for those who can, and 1-star for those who can't. I must appease the average, and therefore award 3 stars.\n\nThis last weekend I visited The Herb Box for the first time and truly enjoyed the food. I sampled a few different items off of the menu (stole bites from friends) and was impressed with almost everything. My personal favorite was the Brussel Sprout flatbread I had. Very unique and extremely savory. Nobody had any real complaints about the food quality/quantity/taste at our table of 12. Compliments to the chef.\n\nI don't need to bash the service, as there are already plenty of 1-star reviews that take care of that, and I agree with most of them. Quote of the night (40 minutes after we ordered and still hadn't seen food yet)...\nFriend: \""Excuse me sir, can we place our order\""\nWaiter: \""You already have ordered\""\nFriend: \""Oh, that was so long ago, I forgot\""\n\nI genuinely enjoyed the food, and am thankful I had a group of friends with me that helped occupy the time while we waited. I may be back, but I won't expect City Hall attentiveness."
"4","Not a big fan of American and especially Charlotte strip clubs.  Had my full of the Canadian Ballet when I lived on the border at the Ontario drinking age of 19 and that was 1000x better.  I am also really not a fan of strip clubs that serve food, but this is an exception.  It's close to work and they have awesome lunch specials every weekday.  People rave about the Wednesday lunch buffet, but I go here for me red meat craving on free steak Fridays.  You get a free 10 ounce, decent ribeye plus $2 sides and it's all good.  They hit you on the drink at $3.85 for soda, but I don't know where else in town you can get a decent 10 ounce steak, two good sides, and a drink for $8.  They get crowded on Friday so the service can be a little bit slow, but it's not too bad.  The food really is good here...there is no question about that."
"3","Having been to Carmine's in NYC we knew what to expect in the way of portion size and the general menu. Carmine's salad was very good the veal parmigiana and the rigatoni with proscuitto were just ok. Veal a little overdone and the rigatoni was the same as any mediocore Italian place serves in NY. And what's with the glasses? Small glass for water (Vegas, Dry, Hot) same small glass for wine. I know that is how it is served in Italy but dude this is Nevada. Capisce?"
"4","The Glass House is a definite case of my expectations being blown out of the water in the very best of ways.\n\nMost of their advertising is wine-centric which makes sense. It's inside FABO which people already knew for wine. And they have lots of neat, interesting wines. If one of the bottles behind the bar doesn't suit you, you can pick a bottle from the shelf stock as long as you intend to buy  2 glasses. Anything left goes behind the bar for others to try.\n\nBut besides the wine, Katie, face behind The Glass House, has made sure that craft beer doesn't get lost in the shuffle. She is working without a tap system do to space limitations (which is the only reason I couldn't justify all 5 stars) but she bottle/can list is impressive and reasonably priced (between $4-$6 for 12ozs; larger bottles are obviously more).\n\nThe front section of the space has gotten a nice face lift so you will definitely be able to enjoy your potables in style, but me, I like to belly up to the bar and partake in some good old fashioned bartender banter. I see a stool with my name on it."
"1","We use Banfield as our Vet and have been very disappointed in this location. The computers are synced to the other Banfield locations, but they refused to sell me heartworm preventative even though I was current on the tests for my dog because I didnt have the test performed at this location. They could see I was current and even stated that. I had to drive over to the Banfield location I use regularly and they explained that is not a policy and the staff just must not have wanted to deal with it. Prior to this experience I used the Vet here once and he didnt give me much time and seemed annoyed with my visit although it was a routine check up. I would rather drive a little further than ever go back to this location."
"3","The crowd here is kind of sleazy, even for vegas. Also once a person latches onto you, it's hard to lose them with the way the place is set up. \n\nSecond time here. We bypassed a crapload of people in line on a Sunday night Labor Day weekend, and walked right to the elevator to the roof. That is the great part of coming with just one other girl to these clubs. I would have been pissed if I had had to wait or pay to get in there. Just saying.\n\nI love the view from the rooftop, and that there are two levels. It is much easier to enjoy the place on a breezy summer night, it is unbearable in the colder seasons.  They play some old school hip hop which is always fun. The bartenders are also pretty cool, much more attentive than at the more trendy XS and Marquee. The drinks are almost as expensive though and of course I forgot to use my free drink tickets and almost all the guys in there are either 24 or 48 and super cheap. Hey I'd be cheap too if I were a guy clubbing in vegas. Girls can be vultures.  \n\nIt was fine, but it wasn't badass and it was really complicated to try to find the exit, of course that was 3 vodka somethings and one witchdoctor later, so that might have been a perception problem ;)"
"4","Food excellent. Service, only one person manning place. It was a Sunday and usually he is there by himself according to the guy. We were lucky there were only two other parties there but it still took a good 30 minutes to get our food. Food was excellent & plentiful, my kids loved the garlic fries, BBQ fries & lemonade. Pastrami sandwich, Pastrami burger, Philly cheese steak & Italian beef were all excellent. Don't expect a 3 star ambiance, there is none only plentiful & excellent  comfort food."
"4","Great chicken and pasta dish.  Excellent service.  Loved sitting on the patio.  All Fox Restaurants are great."
"2","I'm making some brussels sprouts with bacon for dinner so I was reminded to write a review of Eddie's.\n\nWe were in AZ for spring training and needed somewhere to have dinner for a party of 6. We went to Eddie's on St. Patrick's Day because they were the only restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale that had a large seafood selection on their menu and we were in the mood for fish. Turns out that the menu they have online is not the same as the one they have in the restaurant but there were still some good seafood options.\n\nIt was very busy because of the holiday so I expected slower service. Surprisingly the service was not very slow given how busy they were. Our waiter was a bit odd and tried hard to be charming but ended up just being weird. Two ladies at our table decided to split a bottle of wine. He told one he didn't need to see her ID but told the other he needed to see hers. I jokingly said \""next time, just ask for both IDs so you don't offend one\"" to which he awkwardly responded that he thought the woman was about 25. Too little too late but it started our meal off on a funny note. The waiter also seemed pretty condescending about the ladies ordering a \""strong\"" bottle of red wine. Apparently women can't handle bold wines?\n\nMany of the items on the menu are available in half portions, which seems nice at first. But, we were told the half portions were tiny so we should order full portions even though we had salads/soups as well. The prices for the half portions didn't even make it appealing to order two half portions so you could try more items. So, I'm not sure why they bother with the half portions.\n\nOne of the specials was arctic char over kale with gruyere. I love kale, char and gruyere so I quickly ordered that. I also ordered a side of brussels sprouts with bacon and a wedge salad. My salad was good so if you're a fan of wedge salads, order it. My entree arrived but my brussels sprouts did not. By the time I got the waiter's attention, we were nearly half way through our food. Since we were sitting in front of the kitchen I knew my brussels hadn't been made and they wouldn't have time to make them properly. But, our waiter assured me they would be out shortly. I heard the kitchen frantically trying to get the brussels out. When they arrived at the table, they looked moist and raw with some sad, dry pieces of bacon sprinkled around. Against my better judgement, I tried one. It was all but raw. I thought maybe that one just didn't get cooked and tried another. Same deal. The bacon also had no flavor and there was absolutely no seasoning on the sprouts. My friend tried some too and could barely get one down. I told the waiter they were raw and tasted terrible and he said \""that's how we cook them here...al dente.\"" I don't know about you, but brussels sprouts are not a vegetable I like undercooked. They are bitter and hard if you don't cook them thoroughly. They were taken off our bill without me asking so that was good.\n\nBack to the arctic char. The fish was cooked well and had nice flavor. Unfortunately the chef seems to hate vegetables so the kale was absolutely drowning in gruyere. I couldn't actually taste any kale. The kale was just a delivery device for the cheese which is a shame, because I love kale as much as I love brussels sprouts. My friend also ordered the char and kept asking why it was so salty. It wasn't actually salty, it was just that there was so much cheese that it seemed salty.\n\nMy boyfriend had the lobster bisque and the scallops. Both were good. The scallops were cooked perfectly. They make for a light dinner though so make sure to order something else with them. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals.\n\nOn our way out, we met Eddie. He is very friendly and personable and I hate leaving this poor review but I have to be honest about our experience so they can improve. I asked Eddie about the brussels sprouts and he said he does undercook them but they shouldn't have been raw. He admitted he didn't taste them before they went out and apologized. They had a crew there filming the restaurant for a show on Food Network so maybe we'll see Eddie on TV. If we go back to Scottsdale I don't know that we'll go to Eddie's again. But that doesn't mean I don't think you should try it. Just don't get the brussels sprouts or any vegetable with cheese.\n\nThey do have a bar area that looked pretty happening if you're looking for a place to grab a drink and a quick meal."
"4","Clean and security was very friendly with a baby"
"1","This has got to be the most over priced under taste place in the airport.  15 dollars for a salad that is maybe worth 5?  Seriously?  Keep walking and save your wallet.  Wendy's is better."
"2","This was a let down. My best friend planned her Birthday dinner here and so she called ahead for a reservation for dessert and drinks and was told she couldn't! Could not make a reservation for dessert and cocktails in the dining area! Ridiculous! Was given a hard till she asked to speak with a manager. \nShe didn't want to say for sure if we would be eating but we all ended up ordering food the night of. \nWhen we arrived our reservation wasn't ready, the restaurant wasn't even half full, and then they set up the wrong table. So we had to wait for them to fix it. I ordered the mac and cheese triangles? and they tasted like fish sticks and the entire table agreed with me. For being a pricey place we expected a better reception and experience, just let down over all. The server was really friendly and great though. Appreciated her."
"3","The food is still great, but it looks like they have too much success and have stopped trying. The last time we were there, back on March 1st (my birthday, by the way), the buffet was all but empty, the service had gone downhill, and it was stuffy inside. We kept waiting for new additions to the buffet, but none came. Of course, we were still charged full price. They had better step it up--I just reviewed two new competitors that will give them trouble otherwise."
"3","I agree with Britt - surprisingly good. I was a little concerned with sushi from a buffet, but I tried a couple of pieces and it was good. The bar contained a wide variety of items - from typical Chinese buffet foods, grilled chicken, to crab legs. Even a Mongolian grill in the back, but I didn't try it out. One of the most impressive things was the desserts. A couple kinds of cake, brownie, ice cream - all yummy. AND, a sign at the cash register revealed they have champaigne - including Asti Spumante! I haven't seen that since 1978! All in all, a good trip. 2 buffets with 2 soft drinks, $24.66."
"2","So disappointed.  After hearing great things about this place, it was really disappointing when we tried the frozen hot chocolate that tasted like frozen chocolate milk mix.  It's really overpriced for what it is.  I wouldn't even want to order it if it was cheap.  Not really tasty.  With so many other tasty places in Vegas, I would not want to come back here again."
"2","I picked up two pizzas today for lunch and both were dry...dry...dry!"
"2","It's okay but kinda pricey for a combo meal.  $30 for 4 no drinks.  Quality is mediocre and it's a Sunday lunch."
"1","I am from Miami, Florida where you can find most of the Blue Martini's Bars. I never had any bad experience with any of the Blue Martinis here in Florida. I love las Vegas! but Las Vegas Blue Martini, they are a joke! I went there with my boyfriend because I read that supposedly now it is a local hot spot but we couldn't enter just because our outfit!  We didn't went with tshirts and flip flops. It is like the other girl's review its a BAR!!!!! in a Mall. Come on! I do not want to sound arrogant but we have a clear fashion sense! My boyfriend who is a model went with a style fashion tennis that for sure the door man want them to have but he didn't allow the entrance just because my boyfriend didn't have a fancy shoes. We went to other hot places like TAO, Ghost Bar at Palms, Lavo,Jet! which they are NIGHTCLUBS and my boyfriend went with the similar outfit (fashion tennis) and we did not have any problem with the entrance. Actually  he received a lot of compliments from the door guys of those places. I think that the Blue Martini staff should modify the strict code or at least give to the door guys some fashion lessons to teach them how to recognize a good outfit from a bad outfit. We were just a nice couple that wanted to have some drinks and have good time in the supposedly local hot spot. Do not ruin the locals reputation with these poor impressions. I think they lost and they will keep losing from others customers like us. We still love LAS VEGAS!!"
"2","I have been to Sushi Eye several times and I am disappointed by the service and the owners tonight.  My husband loves sushi and he loves to go there.  They have their Buy one roll at full price and get the secoond one for 1/2 price roll special, which is so lame!  We ordered 6 rolls ranging from $9-$14 and 2 rolls which were non sushi rolls ranging from $3.50-$5.00.   Well they took the lower price rolls as the 1/2 price items when we got more higher price rolls.  I am not cheap by any means, but because I am not a sushi eater, I asked them to separate my lower priced items to not mess up the discount!  Well they separated the tickets, but discounted just the same!  I asked the owner and he said \""You want the higher discount?', I said yes, he said no, it is the same table, you can't get the higher discount.  I think that is so stupid and I am not really complaining about $10.00, but in this economy and with the competition for sushi bars, you don't want to keep a loyal customer??  \n\nWell I can say that we will not be back to visit this establishment again."
"3","Moto does everything good, but it never rises to great. They have an eclectic menu and there's tons for non-sushi eaters, too. Good value for dollar spent and usually walk away full and happy."
"2","My son had an appointment at 8:30 am for wisdom teeth extraction. We arrived at appointment at 8:25am. However the waiting room was packed clearly indicating that many other patients also had 8:30 appointments. We waited in the waiting room for 45 minutes then were brought to consult room to review procedure then back to waiting room again. Felt pretty good that it was almost our turn. However epic scheduling fail on dr Moxleys staff. This time we waited 2 hours until my son was called in. So in total it took 2 hours and 45 minutes after scheduled appointment time to just get back into dentists chair. I understand that sometimes  procedures can take longer than expected. But I am paying for a service and this wait isn't acceptable. Sadly I will not refer to this dentist even though he was very good due to his scheduling problems. My time is just as important as his and his staff."
"1","I took my girlfriend around to the various jewelry stores at Mills to help get an idea of what to get her for a ring. Most of the stores were not busy, and didn't mind that we were looking for style, not to buy. We actually had a good experience here for the first half, as my gf showed me very specifically the things she liked and didn't like. I had asked her to be specific about everything, not so that I would have a one-in-a-million shot at the ring, but so that I could really get to know her taste.\n\nAt the end of our shopping, I looked at my soon to be fiancee and said, \""Thanks, I think I have a good idea of what to get for you.\"" The saleswoman looked over and said, \""Good luck... you're going to need it.\"" \n\nFor the rest of the day, my girlfriend was devastated and embarrassed. The saleswoman had basically just told me, \""Good luck pleasing that uptight, high maintenance woman of yours.\"" \n\nRing-browsing was supposed to be a really romantic, memorable experience for us as a couple... Kinda hoping to do this whole thing once! But because this woman couldn't keep her opinion to herself, my girlfriend was made to feel like a needy @!$#! on a day that she should've felt like the most important girl in the world. \n\nThis experience was absolutely unforgivable, and I urge everyone to take their business elsewhere."
"4","Great place to eat! Make a reservation on the weekend or you will have to wait!"
"1","We arrived at Caesars with our three daughters and their boyfriends to get our 4 reserved rooms for our once a year family vacation.  Only one room was ready at 3:30pm, so all 8 of us hung out in that room.  By around 4:30 they finally brought us the keys to two more rooms.  We gave those rooms to our daughters.   My husband and I waited until almost 6pm (we arrived a before 1pm) and finally called down to see if our room was ready.  It was!  So I happily went down to pick up the keys.  Then I went upstairs, put the key in the door, and walked in on two people in bed.  Mortified, I apologized and left.  Went back down to the front desk and talked to the same incompetent woman who checked us in  and gave me the wrong key (Emma), and she didn't even know which room the was supposed to be our 4th room!  Asked for the manager (David), who was able to figure it all out.  Asked for the contact # of the head of the front desk staff, he told me a woman's name.  Then he gave me the contact info for a man (Tyler) instead because \""the head woman is too hard to reach\"".  Got up to our room finally at almost 7pm and found a room that was smaller than the other 3 rooms and no king bed :(\nVery sorry start to our weekend."
"4","Popped into the bookstore for a bit to make some time pass while my wife was nearby in an appointment. Surprise, there's a small coffee shop here in a space that could well be a closet.\n\nBut the coffee was better than the stuff they sling at *$ and it wasn't any more expensive."
"5","It's fun...\nThis place has live shows and lots of little shops to spoil yourself with. I got ice cream and and burger. And I sat and watched a few acts for free that they offer. Its like being at the circus and all the employees are extra nice. Hmmm I got popcorn and they gave me a huge free water with ice! I liked that they have a lot of nickel machines to play slots. This is a nice place to hang out I will be back ASAP. This place is cool it does not break ya bank and most of all you will have a nice time if your with family its super kid friendly and family focused."
"1","I want to start out saying that at one time I really liked kona grill. I hadn't been there for awhile and unfortunately the quality just seems to have taken a dive. \nWe had the sweet and spicy shrimp appetizer. The shrimp were soggy, and I'd be inclined to call it candied soggy shrimp. It was as though a jar of sugar had been poured over the dish. The shrimp were also on crispy rice noodles that are normally edible. These tasted like stale styrofoam. Dish was indelible and thankfully they took it off our bill. \nWe also had the chicken lettuce wraps...extremely salty and also borderline I edible. We chocked back some of the chicken since we were in a rush and were then afraid to try anything else. \nBasically a lot of sugary and over salted processed food. If I go back ill stick to the sashimi."
"4","This was my first visit.  It's a beautiful cafith e indoor and outdoor seating.,   It was too hot for me to sit outside but they had large umbrellas with misters and the pool beyond so others might like it.\n\nI visited Bouchon just last week and I have to say hands-down Terrqace Pointe Cafe is better.  The service was a bit slow... I'm guessing a lot of people have the \""monday flu\"" after a busy weekend!  None the less the food was really terrific.  First and foremost they had a healthy fresh green juice that I love and enjoy so that was a treat.  I ordered trio of eggs benediict and except for a couple of minor things, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Perfect sauce.  Pefectly poached eggs.  One had lobster and it was simply overcooked.  That came with corn and green been hash that was fresh, fresh, fresh and perfectly al dente.  One of the trios was with pork belly on a bisquit.  It may have been pork belly but i think most people would know it as thick cut bacon.  Tasty but not the slow cooked, soft and uber fatty pork belly I've had elsewhere.\n\nMy criticisms are really minor. I darn near licked the plate clean.  (and might have it no on was looking!)    Overall, really pretty.  Immaculate bathrooms and everything else... I would definitely go back."
"1","Apparently I'm too nice. I wrote in my last review after they drove spikes into my nice silk strapless dress that I was sure they would've taken care of it, had I gotten off my lazy ass, because they really are wonderful folks. \n\nWrong. WRONG!!!\n\nI am too nice. Period. I brought in a pair of pants that I had altered recently... taken in at the waist and replaced back buttons for a mere $23 Oh, I should mention the back buttons were missing due to Regal cleaners services. Did I ever complain then? Nope. Should I have? Yup.\n\nUpon getting these pants back, they were missing a button and had weird white stuff on them. I figured they would take care of it. I took the pants in, explained that I had just had them altered (great work at The Fit Alterations, BTW) and now they were damaged. The manager was out and I waited on the call back. \n\nI miss the call and stopped by that night only to be told that the white stuff was the fabric wearing out and that was from normal wear and tear. Um, ok. They weren't like that at all when I brought them in and now they are almost unwearable (especially because of the button flap sticking out on the ass of the pants because you took it off... yet AGAIN).\n\nNo offer was made to put the button back on... no offer of returning my money for the last cleaning of said pants. Nothing. If they'd sewn the button back on, at least I could've worn them one last time. Yes, I am that cheap, I would've worn them even with the white junk all over. Now, they are trash. Expensive trash. It's just weird that they went from fine to completely unwearable in one single visit to the cleaners. \n\nAnd that was the day that Regal lost my family's business."
"4","Not bad. Had a couple pints of Fullers and a burger. The place is pretty cool but more a pub on name than reality. All though I did give them an extra star for having a Manchester United flag hanging inside. \n\n\nFood was decent a so was the service. I'd drop in next time I'm around."
"2","I like the idea, but many overpriced...non collectors items. Maybe more marketing for high quality funky donations would help success. \nNeedless to say I didn't find anything I wanted. \nI would love to see this thrift store succeed, because of the good work it does as well as I just love Alice."
"4","We stopped in for something light before heading to the ballgame.  (Gotta have room for a hot dog at the ball park).\n\nWe split the club sandwich and it was just right.  \n\nService was attentive and the retro decor was welcoming and comfortable.  Nice selection of wines.\n\nI would definitely return if the opportunity came up."
"1","Not sure how this is the first one star review of this place... but here goes.\n\nDriving home today, I wanted something QSRish, but without a drive thru since my three year old would have insisted on getting french fries. Since Wednesday is not Fry-day, except last week when Penn Central was giving them away for free, I wasn't about to alter course and give in to her jones for fries.\n\nSo, I decided get some take out from Asian 1. We had heard bad things about this place, but had never tried it before. I guess it was my duty to fall on the grenade to definitively put whatever nails in the coffin this place needed in our household.\n\nFirst off, this must be a money laundering front for the Chinese mob. There were two people in this place. It looked like the kitchen hadn't been used all day except to prepare lunch for these two. I have rarely seen people going in and out of this place, so it's not like today was an anomaly. I decided to go basic and order General Tso's because, how can you f*** up General Tso's right? It came with an egg roll and my choice of rice. Price was under $6... the ONLY positive.\n\nThe egg roll was among, if not the worst I've ever had. And this comment is coming from a man who has eaten Takee Outee egg rolls on Bourbon Street. Those were better. There wasn't enough sweet and sour sauce available to make this tasteless fried cylinder of wonton tasty.\n\nThen came the General Tso's. It wasn't even mall food court quality. It was pretty weak. Very little spice...like they sprinkled a bit of cayenne in their sweet and sour sauce. The meat was probably not chicken.. and if it was, it was McNugget quality. The flash frying of whomever provides the pre-cooked breaded chicken for this place pretty much reduced what meat was inside the breading to mere molecules.\n\nSeriously, if you are driving down Ardrey Kell and you want Asian, skip Asian 1 and go into Harris Teeter... pick up either frozen PF Changs or Wanchai Ferry. So what if you have to cook it yourself... it's a small price to pay versus getting food at Asian 1."
"5","i LOVE this place.. their buffet, food, and service can't be beat. they make you feel like family, and keep you happy during your entire time with them. I love their pan con bistec, pollo asado, arroz con pollo, and ropa vieja. Almost everything I've had I loved.. their tres leche cake is AMAZING & so is their flan. I almost always get the el riquimbin cubano for dessert, which is tres leches cake topped with flan.. omg to die for!! i also had their chocolate tres leches cake which is the best ever.. the strawberry juice and cuban milkshakes are the BEST ever.. definitely add this place to your list, cuz it's gonna be your ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!!"
"4","If you love Chocolate...If you love the smell of chocolate...if you are a chocolate fan...Than this is the must go spot for anybody who wants chocolate....\n\nMy friend saw this place and her eyes just beamed and glowed and she was we have to go and sit here...\n\nI'm not the biggest chocolate fan but I did taste some and it was just too sweet for my tastes...but it was great place for me to pickup some gifts for other people...\n\nThey had a huge variety of items in their shop...attached to the restaurant.\n\nIf you love to drink chocolate they sell these milk chocolate syringes that you heat up in the microwave and just put it in your mouth to enjoy..."
"2","decent salsa but chips were crumbly. really good abondegas soup."
"5","I love this place.  The food is fresh and high quality.  For as good as the food is, the prices are great!  Highly reccommend if you have never been!"
"3","Would rate the food, for a bagel shop, a 4-5, but their PRICES are sooooo inconsistent. For price issues along I wanted to give them a ONE STAR, but their service and food is usually okay, so I rated them a 3 to be fair.  I have eaten here probably 15+ times in the past year and I continue to be charged inconsistently. I don't know if it is from the high turnover of staff or that the owners keep changing the prices. As of today though, I think I am done. While I like supporting a local business, and their food is good, I would rather go to a chain bagel shop where their prices are visible, I will get a receipt showing what I purchased, and know I am always going to be charged what the menu says. \n\nIt is WORSE now that they just remodeled the place - they now have a new menu, which does look better but one huge oversight, ummmmm....where are the prices? They have a giant board of selections but seriously, you want people to blindly order, blindly pay, and have the ability to increase prices without your customers knowledge? This is not a five star restaurant where it would be distasteful to show your prices. People want consistency, people want to know how much their food is going to cost. \n\nNothing eats at me more than feeling like I was overcharged for something but I have no room to question it since their prices are listed nowhere. This morning I got one plan bagel sandwich which I believe used to be around $4.80? And I got one small sized soft drink (sodas don't cost much) and one plain bagel with nothing on it (which used to be $0.92 and my total was over $10? What?!\n\nI don't know if the cashier charged me wrong or they decided to charge more for drinks than their food but I am so over this place. You are conveniently located to me, have pretty tasty bagels, but the food is no better than what I could get from an Einstein Bagels. Sorry Bagel Nosh, if you start listing your prices again and stop being so shady about the cost of a bagel, maybe I will consider coming back."
"4","I've been here only twice but enjoyed it so much that I wanted to review it even though I haven't had the food yet...both times have been with other girls to catch up over a few glasses of wine and it's the perfect spot for just that.  There is an amazing wine list that always has super deals, they have a good beer selection and the tapas menu looked yummy (friends had the crab and corn dip and the potatoes, said both were great).  \n\nThe decor is cool as well with natural wood all over and local artwork...was there this past Saturday and they had live music - the place was full of couples at tables, so it's a great date place, but also just singles at the bar and few groups of girls too...if you like wine, I highly recommend it, it's a nice quaint spot in Uptown that's a refreshing change from the intensity of the Epicentre."
"3","Though this hotel is a bit dated, their location is great. Btw- it's scheduled for a full remodel soon. Their staff is very helpful and friendly. Very good & pricy Chinese food in their restaurant; but their servers seem tired and uninterested. We were only in town for 2 nights, so the price was right, even with $27 per night self-parking fee, which is less than most other locations. It's not fancy, but the room was comfy and very clean."
"3","Review for the Lounge/Club:\nEvery time I go to Vegas this is always one of my stops- primarily because of the view. I started going years ago before it was super hyped up and packed almost all the time. I also remember the days when the Witch Doctors were twice the size they are now (and weaker than they used to be!). Voodoo hasn't changed much in the past 5 years except going cheap on the drinks and over packing the club with VIP sections that are unused (which is totally annoying if you're trying to see the view without a bunch of drunk asses running into you). \n\nThe DJs are consistently good and it has a very, very mixed crowd. However, I only keep coming back for the view- it doesn't compare to anything else. Ghost Bar has nothing on this place. \n\nAlso, over the years the award winning flair bartending has leveled off (I think I saw one bottle throw the whole time we were there) and it's not nearly the show it used to be which is really disappointing. If you ever have a chance to catch the episode of Three Sheets on Spike where Zane goes to Vegas- you'll see what I mean. The show was filmed several years ago and even there you can see the Witch Doctor and the flair are way better than they are now. \n\nFor newcomers I think this is a great place to at least see once just because the view is so amazing. However, for those who have been going back over and over again- it's turning into a huge disappointment. \n\nFor the Restaurant:\n\nI've dined here several times and price-wise it runs about the same as any other high end steak house you'd find on the strip. Mostly we ate here out of convenience since the selection at Rio isn't the greatest for food. The service has been reasonably decent and the food was good however, if dinner is going to cost around $100 a person I want to be wowed. The whole experience didn't seem like a 5 star dining like when we went to Strip House (wow! by the way). The servers were friendly but only slightly knowledgeable about the wine list and it seemed like there wasn't enough coverage for the tables which made dinner take forever. I don't really remember much more than that which is disappointing because I wish it were more memorable for the price paid. Been there, done that- won't be back to Voodoo Steak when there's so many better options for the same price."
"4","Standard Starbucks with a drive-thru, friendly staff. Only ever had my order wrong once and I didn't throw it back in their face as other Starbucks patrons have been known to do.\n\nVenti iced green tea with three pumps of classic. Best way to stay hydrated in this 105 degree weather! ^.^"
"4","This small surprise of a find really made me happy. Originally I had gone to the shopping complex for Euro Cafe...it is closed and it looks like there is a frame store in its place.\n\nIt is located on the northeast corner of Longmore and Southern directly behind McDonald's and right next to Life Uniform.\n\nBTW -- What is it with strip malls with strip malls behind the strip mall? Also, what's up with the inability to properly NUMBER a freaking building? The numbers here are hidden so well, you practically have to run into the building with your car...even though it won't actually guarantee that you will find the number.  URGH\n\nAnyway, I digress...sorry! For a scant $10 I was surprised to get a 12 inch philly cheesesteak with fries and a drink.\n\nThe meat was lovely and not mega greasy like some other Philly Cheesesteak places. The cheese also wasn't added on top as an afterthought, either. They had taken the time to actually blend it with the meat, onions and mushrooms -- heavenly! The result is something that doesn't stretch for miles on end after you take a bite, only to sloppily land on your shirt or even worse, drop food onto your lap or plate. The fries were not dipped in salt like Two Hippies. They serve Coke products -- boo, hiss!\n\nThe owner (or I am assuming he is the owner) and I were talking about Euro Cafe...He said it's been closed for over a year. He said I should try the Gyro next time...and I will.\n\nDecor is scant, but functional...and it is wonderfully clean. You won't feel like you've stumbled into the kind of place that will make you feel sick after the first bite - I loved it here.\n\nI really hope this place does well. I have my reservations because of where it is located - behind two fast food restaurants and a strip mall that's about 20% empty. I wouldn't have found this place if I hadn't pulled over to google Euro Cafe on my phone."
"3","When you have a craving for a milkshake or sundae, this it the place!  They have many different flavors and will make one up for you if you ask.\nThe waistaff is always friendly and happy to chat.\nI like that at this location there is outdoor seating and you can have meetings with groups.\nThey have a Blue Moon burger with bleu cheese that's really good, too!"
"3","I visited Montreal on Formula 1 weekend (worldcup opening weekend also) soo this street was overcrowded so as Newtown! the DJ played lots of oldskool, I recommend it more for a 25+ crowds, drinks where not too strong maybe it was because of the overcrowd going on."
"5","I've really got to hand it to our tour guide on Mary King's Close. His enthusiasm, historical knowledge and showmanship was a joy to behold. His refreshing honesty about what actually happened here also inadvertently removed much of the inherent spookiness of the underground street, but you've got to admire a guy who will tell it like it is.\n\nAll over Edinburgh, you will find \""factual\"" books on Mary King's Close. They tell of a place where an underground community were forced to live, isolated, poor, and shut off from society. You've got a script for a semi-decent horror film right there.. \n\nOur erstwhile guide however, was more than happy to shatter the illusion with wit and honesty. As soon as Mary King's Close was built over, everyone was moved out. No-one ever lived underground there. Great as it was to hear the truth, I'm sure you'll understand that this went a long way to removing the signature creepiness and oppressive atmosphere I'd expected of the tour.\n\nStill fascinating though, with my personal favourite part being the unbelievably well preserved house, still with wallpaper. The emphasis on facts made it a bit less creepy than a ghost walk through the vaults, but still a stellar tour nonetheless."
"1","Very bad workers need to get there story straight before they take action accusing people wrongly. Going to tell everyone I know about that incident that happened.  That will ruin your business. I always shopped there very clean store but never again. You don't go around accusing people stealing. That poor person that got searched and came out clean by cops use your damn cameras before you do shit like that"
